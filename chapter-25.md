# Chapter 25: Winter Formal

I spent most of Friday in a state of suspended decision.

Part of me wanted to go to the formal with Blake—wanted it so badly it was a physical ache. The thought of walking in with him, of choosing each other publicly despite his father's threats, felt right in a way I couldn't articulate.

But the practical part—the part that had kept me safe and fed and moving forward for years—screamed that this was reckless. That risking my scholarship for a relationship, no matter how much I cared about Blake, was exactly the kind of choice that destroyed futures.

"You're wearing a path in the carpet," Emma said from her bed where she was getting ready for the formal. She was going with a group of friends—all scholarship students who'd decided to attend together.

"I can't decide."

"Yes, you can. You just don't want to." Emma set down her mascara. "Rachel, what's the worst that can happen?"

"I lose my scholarship, can't finish senior year, don't graduate, my entire future collapses."

"Okay. And if Blake's right? If the board doesn't tolerate William using scholarships as leverage?"

"Then..." I stopped. "Then we get away with it. For now. Until his father finds another way to retaliate."

"Or until Blake turns eighteen, goes to college, makes his own choices and his father has to accept it." Emma came over, sat beside me on my bed. "You're looking at worst-case scenarios. What about best-case?"

"Best-case is I go to the formal with Blake, we have one magical night, and then reality crushes us anyway."

"That's not best-case. That's pessimism." Emma squeezed my hand. "Best-case is you go to the formal, have a magical night, Blake's father realizes he can't control his adult son through threats, and you two get to actually try being together. Really together."

I wanted to believe her. God, I wanted to believe that was possible.

"I'm terrified," I whispered.

"I know. But you're also in love. And sometimes love is worth being terrified for."

At six-thirty, I made my decision.

Emma helped me get ready, lending me the dress she'd bought for formal but decided not to wear. It was simple but beautiful—deep blue, fitted but modest, perfect for the occasion.

"You look amazing," Emma said, fixing my hair. "Blake's going to lose his mind."

"If I actually go through with this."

"You're going through with it. I can tell." She smiled. "You've got that look. Like you're about to do something brave and possibly stupid."

"Those often go together."

"The best choices usually do."

At six forty-five, I stood outside my dorm building, wrapped in my coat against the December cold. The Winter Garden was across campus. Blake said he'd wait at the entrance at seven.

I had fifteen minutes to get there. Or to turn around, change into work clothes, and report to my scheduled cleanup shift.

Safety or risk. Fear or courage. Protection or love.

I started walking toward the Winter Garden.

---

The conservatory glowed with lights—white and gold, strung through the winter plants and hanging from the glass ceiling. Through the windows, I could see students already inside, dressed in formal wear, dancing and laughing. The perfect Ashford Academy event.

Blake stood at the entrance, dressed in a suit that fit him perfectly, looking nervous and hopeful and terrified. When he saw me approaching, his face transformed.

"You came," he said, like he'd half-expected me not to.

"I came." My voice shook slightly. "I'm still terrified. But I came."

Blake held out his hand. "We can still turn back. If you're not sure—"

"I'm not sure about anything except that I'm tired of letting your father decide what I get to have." I took his hand, feeling the familiar warmth, the rightness of it. "Let's do this."

We walked into the Winter Garden together.

The effect was immediate. Conversations stopped mid-sentence. Heads turned. I felt the weight of every eye in the room assessing us—Blake Ashford III and the scholarship student, walking in together as a couple.

Natalie stood near the refreshments table, her face going from surprise to fury in seconds. Kit was nearby, and when he saw us, he broke into a huge grin and gave Blake a thumbs up.

Dr. Sullivan, chaperoning near the entrance, caught my eye. She nodded once, approving and supportive.

"You okay?" Blake murmured, his hand tight on mine.

"Ask me in five minutes."

The whispers started then—not even trying to be subtle. I heard fragments: "...scholarship student..." "...his father will lose it..." "...what is he thinking..."

Blake pulled me onto the dance floor. The band was playing something slow and romantic. He put his arms around me, and I let myself lean into him, feeling his heartbeat against my cheek.

"Thank you for coming," he said quietly. "For being brave enough to try this."

"Thank you for being worth it."

We swayed together, and for a few minutes, the rest of the room faded. It was just us, like in the library study room, like in the falling snow. Just Rachel and Blake, choosing each other despite everything stacked against us.

Then I saw him.

William Ashford stood at the entrance to the Winter Garden, clearly having just arrived. His face when he saw Blake and me dancing together was thunderous.

"Blake," I whispered. "Your father's here."

Blake stiffened, then deliberately pulled me closer. "I see him."

William crossed the floor with purpose, his expensive suit and commanding presence parting the crowd like Moses and the Red Sea. He stopped just off the dance floor.

"Blake. A word. Now."

"I'm dancing with my date," Blake said calmly, though I could feel his tension.

"This is inappropriate and you know it." William's voice was low but sharp. "You will end this immediately."

"No." Blake's arms stayed around me, protective. "I won't."

The music continued playing, but everyone nearby had stopped dancing to watch. This was it—the public confrontation. William Ashford's power against his son's defiance, with my scholarship hanging in the balance.

"You're making a scene," William hissed. "This is not how Ashfords behave."

"Maybe it should be." Blake's voice was steady now, gaining confidence. "Maybe Ashfords should care about people based on who they are, not what they're worth."

"We will discuss this at home."

"There's nothing to discuss. Rachel is my date. She's brilliant and kind and has more integrity in her little finger than most of your business associates. And I care about her. That's not changing because you disapprove."

William's eyes shifted to me, cold and assessing. "You. You were warned to maintain appropriate boundaries."

Before I could respond, Dr. Sullivan appeared at William's elbow. "Mr. Ashford. Perhaps this conversation would be better had privately."

"This doesn't concern you, Dr. Sullivan."

"Actually, it does. As Blake's teacher and as Rachel's advocate." Her voice was professional but firm. "Any threats regarding Rachel's scholarship would be a matter of institutional concern."

"I haven't threatened anything." William's tone was dangerous.

"Michael Porter has documentation suggesting otherwise." Another voice—I turned to see Kit's father, Gregory Hamilton, approaching. "William, we should talk. Away from the students."

William's jaw clenched. He looked between Blake and me, his son's defiance clear, then at the growing crowd of students watching this play out.

"This conversation isn't over," he said to Blake. "But you're right—this isn't the time or place." He turned and walked away, Gregory following to presumably have that promised conversation.

The music continued. Gradually, people returned to dancing and talking, though I could feel eyes still on us.

"Did that just happen?" I asked, my heart pounding.

"I think so." Blake looked dazed. "Did you hear Kit's father? About wanting to talk to my dad?"

"What does that mean?"

"I don't know. But it's better than my father just revoking your scholarship on the spot."

We finished the dance, then Kit found us.

"My father's pissed," Kit said. "He thinks what your dad did—threatening Rachel's scholarship—crosses a line. He's going to raise it at the next board meeting."

"Seriously?"

"Seriously. Using scholarship leverage to control students' personal lives is an abuse of donor authority. My dad's exact words." Kit grinned. "Turns out even other rich people think that's messed up."

Hope bloomed in my chest, fragile but real. "So my scholarship...?"

"Can't promise anything. But you've got allies now. Faculty, other board members. It's not just you against William Ashford anymore."

Blake pulled me into a hug, and I let myself relax into it. We'd done it. Made our stand, publicly chosen each other, and maybe—maybe—we'd get away with it.

The rest of the formal passed in a blur. Dancing with Blake, talking with other students who approached to say they thought what William had done was wrong, even some legacy kids who admitted the social hierarchy was ridiculous.

Dr. Sullivan stopped by to tell us she was proud of our courage. Michael Porter, also chaperoning, gave me a subtle thumbs up.

When the formal ended, Blake walked me back to my dorm through falling snow. At the entrance, we stopped, neither wanting to say goodnight.

"That was terrifying," I said.

"That was perfect." Blake cupped my face in his hands. "Can I kiss you now? Properly, not interrupted?"

I nodded, unable to speak.

When Blake's lips met mine, it was everything the almost-kiss in the library had promised. Sweet and careful and full of feeling. A beginning, not an ending.

When we pulled apart, both smiling, Blake said, "Worth it?"

"Worth everything."

He kissed me once more, then stepped back. "See you Monday?"

"See you Monday."

I floated up to my dorm room, where Emma was waiting.

"How was it?" she asked.

"Perfect and terrifying and maybe the bravest thing I've ever done." I sat on my bed, still in the borrowed dress. "Emma, I kissed him."

"Finally!"

We stayed up late, me recounting every detail—the confrontation with William, Kit's father's support, the dance, the kiss. By the time I fell asleep, I was still terrified about what came next.

But for the first time in weeks, I was also hopeful.

We'd taken a stand. Made our choice. And maybe, just maybe, we'd survive the consequences.
