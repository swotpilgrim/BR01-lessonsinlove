# Chapter 7: First Real Conversation

By Monday evening's session, I'd started looking forward to seeing Blake. Not in any significant way—just the natural anticipation of working with a student who was finally trying, who was starting to understand the material, who made teaching feel worthwhile instead of frustrating.

That's what I told myself, anyway.

Blake arrived five minutes early, which felt significant. He had his copy of *Gatsby*, a notebook with actual notes, and his three observations written out neatly instead of crumpled.

"Chapter six," he said, sliding the paper across before I could even ask. "Three observations, going deeper."

I read them:

*1. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock—Gatsby stares at it constantly. It represents everything he wants but can't have. The light is always distant, always out of reach, just like his dream of Daisy.*

*2. Tom Buchanan is introduced as having a "cruel body." Not strong or powerful, but cruel. Fitzgerald is showing us Tom's character through physical description—he uses his strength to hurt people.*

*3. Gatsby tells Nick his life story, but it sounds fake—"like he's rehearsed it." Everything about Gatsby is performance. He's created a character instead of being a real person.*

These were good. Really good. Evidence of actual critical thinking, of engagement with themes and character analysis.

"Blake, these are excellent," I said, and I heard the genuine praise in my voice. "You've moved beyond surface observation to interpretation. This is exactly the kind of analysis Dr. Sullivan wants."

Blake looked pleased in a way that seemed almost unfamiliar on his face—like he wasn't used to academic praise that he'd actually earned. "The green light one—I wasn't sure if I was reading too much into it. It's just a light."

"In literature, objects are rarely just objects. Fitzgerald deliberately puts that green light in multiple scenes. He makes Gatsby reach for it. That repetition signals symbolic importance." I pulled out my copy. "What else does green suggest to you? Think about connotations."

Blake thought about it. "Money? Green like dollars?"

"Possibly. What else?"

"Jealousy? 'Green with envy'?"

"Yes. And?"

"Go? Like a traffic light?"

"Absolutely. So the green light could represent wealth, envy, permission to proceed, the American Dream of material success. What do all those meanings have in common when you think about Gatsby?"

Blake leaned forward, engaged. "They're all about wanting something. Desire. Gatsby spends the whole novel wanting Daisy, wanting the life she represents. The green light is... the physical symbol of all his longing."

"Perfect. And what's significant about it being a light? Think about what light does."

"It illuminates things. Shows you where to go." Blake paused. "But Gatsby's light is far away. Across water. He can see it but can't reach it. So it guides him but also... keeps him chasing something impossible?"

I couldn't help smiling. "That's sophisticated literary analysis. You just unpacked layers of symbolism and connected them to character motivation and theme. Do you see how much you actually understand?"

"I guess I do understand it," Blake said, and he sounded genuinely surprised. "When you ask questions like that, make me think about meanings and connections—it makes sense. It's just when I'm trying to write a paper, I freeze. Like I don't know where to start."

"That's structure. Once you have the analysis—which you clearly can do—it's just organizing your ideas." I pulled out my notebook and drew a quick outline format. "Thesis statement that makes your main argument. Body paragraphs that each focus on one piece of evidence with explanation. Conclusion that ties everything together. That's it."

"That's it?"

"The hard part is the thinking, which you're already doing. The writing is just recording your thoughts in an organized way."

Blake studied the outline structure like he was memorizing it. "And I just... fill in my observations and analysis?"

"Exactly. You've already done the work. You noticed the green light, analyzed what it means, connected it to Gatsby's character and the novel's themes. That's a body paragraph right there."

"Why didn't anyone explain it like this before?"

I shrugged. "Different teachers have different approaches. Some assume you already know how to structure arguments. Others focus more on what to think than how to think."

"What about you?" Blake asked. "How'd you learn this?"

"Reading a lot. Having teachers who broke things down. Practicing." I hesitated, then added, "And being genuinely interested in how stories work. That helps."

"You actually like this stuff."

"I do. Literature is about understanding people—why they make choices, how they see the world, what they want and fear. That's fascinating to me."

Blake nodded slowly. "I get that. It's like... business strategy is about understanding people too. Why they buy things, what motivates them, how to predict behavior. Just different applications."

"Exactly. You're using similar analytical skills, just in different contexts."

"My father would hate hearing that comparison," Blake said, and there was something bitter in his voice. "He thinks business is serious and literature is frivolous."

"What do you think?"

Blake was quiet for a moment. "I think I wish I was better at literature. My other classes—business, economics, even math—I'm fine. Sometimes good. But English has always made me feel stupid."

The admission hung in the air between us, vulnerable in a way Blake usually wasn't.

"You're not stupid," I said firmly. "You're demonstrating real analytical ability right now. Whatever made English hard before—maybe teaching style, maybe something else—it doesn't mean you can't do it."

"Rachel." Blake looked directly at me. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Are you good at everything? Like, do you just... automatically understand all your classes?"

I laughed before I could stop myself. "No. God, no. I'm terrible at advanced calculus. Absolutely terrible."

Blake looked genuinely surprised. "But you're—I mean, you have a 4.0."

"Because I work twice as hard in math as I do in humanities. I spend hours on problem sets that probably take other students thirty minutes. I go to every tutoring session. I watch YouTube videos trying to understand concepts my professor explained in two minutes." I felt my face heat with the admission. "I cry over my calculus homework regularly."

"You cry over homework?"

"Calculus makes me feel exactly how you just described feeling about English—stupid and inadequate and like everyone else just gets it except me."

Blake stared at me like I'd revealed something shocking. "But you always seem so confident. Like you have everything figured out."

"That's performance," I said. "Just like Gatsby. We all perform competence while struggling underneath."

"That's actually kind of profound."

"It's also exhausting." I realized I was being more honest than I'd meant to be. "Performing like you belong, like you're good enough, like you deserve to be here—it takes constant energy."

"At least you earned your place," Blake said quietly. "You're here on merit. I'm here because my great-grandfather's name is on the library."

"That doesn't mean you don't deserve to be here."

"Doesn't it? If I fail out, some other kid—someone who actually earned it—gets my spot."

I looked at Blake—really looked at him. Saw past the expensive clothes and the legacy wing privilege to someone carrying different pressure than mine, but pressure nonetheless. Someone who felt like he had to live up to an impossible standard, who wasn't sure he was actually capable, who was terrified of failing publicly.

"You're earning your place now," I said. "By doing this work. By actually trying to learn instead of coasting."

"Because I have to. If I don't, I face probation."

"Maybe. Or maybe because you're finally being taught in a way that works for you, and you're discovering you can actually do this."

Blake was quiet, processing. Then: "Do you ever feel like you're faking it? Like someday someone's going to realize you don't actually belong here?"

"Every single day."

"Really?"

"Really. Scholarship students get reminded pretty regularly that we're guests in someone else's world. That we should be grateful for the opportunity. That we're here by exception, not right."

"That's—" Blake stopped, seeming to struggle with what to say. "That's unfair."

"It's reality."

"It shouldn't be."

I looked at him, surprised. "Blake Ashford thinks the class system at Ashford Academy is unfair?"

"Blake Ashford thinks treating people like they don't belong just because they didn't start with money is—yeah, unfair." He met my eyes. "For what it's worth, I'm sorry. For the 'charity case' comment. That was—I was being a defensive asshole."

The apology caught me completely off guard. "Oh."

"You were right. I showed up unprepared and entitled and expected you to magically fix everything without me having to do actual work. You called me on it, and I lashed out." He looked uncomfortable but sincere. "I'm sorry."

"Thank you," I said quietly. "That... means something."

We sat in silence for a moment, something shifting between us. The hostility that had defined our first sessions had evaporated, replaced by something that felt almost like understanding.

"So," Blake said finally. "Paper structure. You were explaining how to organize my analysis."

I pulled my attention back to teaching. "Right. Let's work on your outline for the Gatsby paper. You've got strong observations—now we just need to arrange them into a coherent argument."

We spent the rest of the session outlining Blake's paper, and it felt different from previous sessions. More collaborative. Less adversarial. Blake asked genuine questions, I gave genuine help, and together we built something that looked like actual literary analysis.

When the session ended, neither of us moved immediately.

"Same time Wednesday?" Blake asked.

"Same time."

"I'll actually do the reading before I show up."

"I know you will."

Blake smiled—a real smile, not the defensive smirk or charming deflection I'd seen before. "Thanks, Rachel. For not giving up on me. Even when I was being awful."

"Thanks for not giving up on yourself. Even when English felt impossible."

He gathered his things, but slowly, like he wasn't in a hurry to leave. At the door, he paused. "You know, you're a really good teacher. Like, actually good. Not just going through motions."

"You're a good student. When you let yourself try."

"I'm trying now."

"I know."

After he left, I sat in the quiet study room feeling something I couldn't quite name. Not friendship—we weren't there yet. Not romance—definitely not romance.

But connection. Real connection with someone I'd written off as everything wrong with Ashford.

Turned out assumptions worked both ways.

And turned out Blake Ashford was more than his family name and legacy wing address.

Who knew?
