# Chapter 4: Legacy Pressure

I didn't know then what Blake's life was actually like. I didn't know where he went after our disastrous first session, or what he was thinking, or what he was dealing with beyond the entitled arrogance I'd seen.

All I knew was my own anger as I walked back to my dorm, my own hurt at being called a charity case, my own certainty that Blake Ashford was exactly the kind of privileged, lazy student I'd always assumed he was.

I wouldn't learn the truth until much later. Wouldn't understand until Blake finally let me see past the defensive walls he'd built just as carefully as I'd built mine.

But that Thursday night, while I was fuming in my dorm room and wondering if I should quit the tutoring position entirely, Blake was dealing with his own version of hell.

---

The legacy wing of Morrison Hall was nothing like the standard dormitories where Emma and I lived. Blake had a private room—not huge, but his own space with a single bed, a desk by the window, built-in bookshelves, and a small common area he shared with his roommate Christopher Hayes. The furniture was nicer, the carpet was newer, and the whole wing had an air of old money and established privilege.

Blake's room looked exactly like you'd expect from a legacy student. Ashford family photos on the desk—his father and grandfather in their own Ashford blazers, looking stern and accomplished. Crew team schedule posted by the door. Expensive laptop, expensive clothes hung neatly in the closet, expensive everything.

But none of it mattered when Blake sat at his desk that night, staring at the blank document on his laptop screen where Dr. Sullivan's paper was supposed to materialize.

*The Great Gatsby* sat closed beside his computer. He'd bought the annotated edition—the expensive one with all the notes and analysis that was supposed to make things easier. It hadn't helped. The words still blurred together when he tried to read them, still slipped away from him like water through his fingers.

Blake heard Kit moving around in the common area, probably working on his own assignments. Kit never seemed to struggle with anything. History papers flowed easily from his fingertips. Reading came naturally. Everything came naturally to Kit, the way it was supposed to come naturally to Blake.

The way it came naturally to Rachel Winters, apparently. Perfect grades, perfect analysis, perfect understanding of every text Dr. Sullivan assigned.

Blake's jaw tightened thinking about the tutoring session. The way Rachel had looked at him—like he was everything wrong with Ashford, like he was a waste of space coasting on his family name. The way she'd pushed him on the *Gatsby* analysis, asking questions he couldn't answer, exposing exactly how little he understood.

She wasn't wrong. That was the worst part.

Blake had been coasting. Had been faking his way through English class since freshman year, giving vague answers that sounded intelligent without actually saying anything, charming teachers into giving him the benefit of the doubt, relying on his name and his smile to carry him through.

It had worked until Dr. Sullivan. She saw right through him, called him on every surface-level response, demanded textual evidence and sophisticated analysis he didn't know how to provide.

And now he was failing. Facing academic probation. And stuck being tutored by the scholarship girl who already hated him.

A knock on his door interrupted his spiral of self-loathing.

"Hey." Kit leaned in, crew practice clothes still on. "How was the tutoring thing?"

Blake closed his laptop. "Fine."

"Yeah?" Kit came in and sat on Blake's bed, stretching his long legs. "Who'd they assign you?"

"Rachel Winters."

Kit's eyebrows rose. "The scholarship girl from our English class? The one who always has her hand up?"

"That's her."

"Bet that was awkward." Kit grinned, oblivious to how much worse than awkward it had actually been. "She's smart though. If anyone can get you through Sullivan's class, probably her."

Blake said nothing.

"Just turn on the charm," Kit continued. "Make her want to help you. You're good at that."

Was he? Blake wasn't sure anymore. The charm hadn't worked on Rachel. She'd seen right through it, looked at him like he was exactly what he was afraid he actually was—useless without his family name.

"Yeah," Blake said, because Kit was waiting for a response. "I'll figure it out."

"You always do." Kit stood, heading back to his own room. "Don't stress too much. It's just English. Not like it actually matters."

But it did matter. Blake's father had made that abundantly clear during his last visit to campus.

After Kit left, Blake opened his laptop again and pulled up his father's last email. He'd read it so many times he'd memorized it, but he read it again anyway, like picking at a scab.

*Blake—*

*I received notification from the Dean regarding your academic standing. I'm profoundly disappointed. Academic excellence is not optional for an Ashford, it is expected. Your grandfather graduated summa cum laude. I graduated magna cum laude. You are facing probation.*

*This is unacceptable. You will accept the tutoring, you will improve your grades, and you will not embarrass this family further. I've made significant donations to ensure you have every advantage—the least you can do is take your education seriously.*

*Ashfords don't fail. We excel. Start acting like an Ashford.*

*Father*

Blake closed the email, his father's words echoing in his head. *Ashfords don't fail. We excel.*

Except Blake was failing. Had been failing for longer than his father knew, longer than anyone knew. He'd just gotten good at hiding it.

The words on the laptop screen seemed to mock him. *Five-page analysis of The Great Gatsby. Due November 22nd. Focus on Fitzgerald's commentary on wealth, class, and the American Dream.*

Blake knew what he was supposed to write. He'd heard Rachel's explanation during their session—the green light as symbol, Nick as unreliable narrator, the critique of empty materialism. He understood it intellectually.

But understanding what to say and actually being able to write it were two different things. When Blake tried to read the novel, the words shifted and blurred. He'd get through a paragraph and realize he'd retained nothing. He'd reread the same page four times and still not be able to summarize it.

It had been like this for as long as Blake could remember. Reading was hard. Writing was harder. He'd learned to compensate—listening carefully in class, memorizing what teachers said, regurgitating their words in different arrangements, speaking eloquently even when his written work was weak.

But it wasn't enough anymore. Not for Dr. Sullivan, who wanted original analysis supported by textual evidence. Not for college applications, which were coming too fast. Not for maintaining the Ashford legacy his father demanded.

Blake had suggested to his father once—years ago, in middle school—that maybe something was wrong. That maybe he had dyslexia or some kind of learning difference that made reading so much harder for him than it seemed to be for everyone else.

His father had dismissed it immediately. *Ashfords don't have learning disabilities. You're just not trying hard enough. Apply yourself.*

So Blake had tried harder. Stayed up later, stared at the words until his eyes burned, forced himself through reading assignments that took him three times as long as they should have.

And he'd hidden it. Hidden the struggle, hidden the hours of extra work, hidden the fact that reading a single chapter of *Gatsby* took him an entire evening of painful concentration.

Better to look lazy than stupid. Better to seem like he wasn't trying than to admit he was trying as hard as he could and still failing.

Blake's phone buzzed with a text from his father: *Meeting with Dean tomorrow. Call me tonight.*

His stomach dropped. His father was on campus. Was meeting with the Dean about Blake's academic probation. This was about to get so much worse.

Blake looked at the blank document on his screen, at the closed copy of *Gatsby* beside his computer, at the Ashford family photos on his desk—generations of successful, accomplished men who'd all excelled effortlessly at everything they touched.

He thought about Monday's tutoring session. Three more sessions a week with Rachel Winters, who looked at him with barely concealed contempt, who thought he was lazy and entitled, who had no idea how much Blake hated himself for not being better.

Blake closed his laptop and picked up *Gatsby* again, forcing himself to focus on the words. But they blurred and swam, the letters rearranging themselves into meaningless shapes.

*Ashfords don't fail.*

But Blake was failing anyway, and he didn't know how to stop.

---

I didn't know any of that Thursday night. Didn't know about Blake's father's emails or his struggles with reading or the pressure crushing him under the weight of family expectations.

All I knew was my own hurt and anger.

I'd told Emma about the session—left out the "charity case" comment because saying it out loud made it hurt worse—and she'd been sympathetic but pragmatic. "Rich kids have egos. He'll either accept the help or fail. Either way, you get paid."

She was right. I should have been able to let it go, to be professional, to collect my paycheck and not care what Blake Ashford thought of me.

But I did care. That was the problem.

I lay in bed that night thinking about Monday's session, dreading it and resenting that I dreaded it. Thinking about Blake's dismissive face when he walked into that study room, the horror in his expression when he realized I was his tutor, the contempt when he called me a charity case.

I wondered if he'd show up Monday or if his father's money and influence would get him assigned to someone else. Someone he deemed more appropriate to teach the great Blake Ashford III.

I wondered why it bothered me so much.

And I wondered, though I hated admitting it, if maybe I'd been too harsh. If maybe calling him lazy had been unfair when I didn't actually know what his situation was.

But no. He'd shown up unprepared, hadn't done the reading, couldn't answer basic questions, and then insulted me when I tried to help.

That wasn't a learning difference. That was entitlement.

I rolled over, punching my pillow into shape, trying to convince myself I believed it.

Monday would come soon enough. Blake would either show up ready to actually work, or he wouldn't.

Either way, I'd be professional. I'd do my job. I'd earn my sixty-seven fifty a week.

And I'd try very hard not to care what Blake Ashford thought of me.
