# Chapter 26: Consequences

The official notice arrived Monday morning.

I was called to the headmaster's office before first period. My stomach dropped when I saw the formal letterhead, the careful legal language, the signature at the bottom.

"Effective immediately, Rachel Winters' scholarship from the Ashford Foundation has been revoked due to inappropriate conduct with students receiving tutoring services..."

The words blurred. I read them again, trying to process. William Ashford had done it. He'd actually followed through.

Headmaster Williams looked uncomfortable. "Miss Winters, I want you to know this decision didn't originate with the school. We've received complaints from Mr. William Ashford regarding your tutoring arrangement with his son."

"Complaints about what, exactly?" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

"He alleges you overstepped professional boundaries. Developed an inappropriate relationship with a student you were hired to tutor."

"Blake and I developed feelings for each other. That's not the same as inappropriate conduct." I forced myself to stay calm. "And this is retaliation for going to winter formal with him Friday night, not legitimate academic cause."

"That's... that may be the case." Headmaster Williams cleared his throat. "However, Mr. Ashford's family provides significant funding to this institution. The board of trustees has decided to honor his request."

"So money matters more than justice."

"Miss Winters—"

"When do I have to leave?" I cut him off, suddenly exhausted.

"You have until the end of the week to make arrangements."

I left his office in a daze. This was it. Everything I'd feared, coming true. William Ashford had used his power exactly as he'd threatened, and the institution had chosen donor money over defending a student.

Word spread fast. By lunchtime, everyone knew my scholarship had been revoked.

Blake found me in the library, where I'd gone to avoid the stares and whispers. He looked devastated.

"Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't think he'd actually do it."

"I knew he would." I kept my voice flat, holding emotions at bay. "You hoped he wouldn't. There's a difference."

"Dr. Sullivan and Michael Porter are fighting it. They're presenting evidence to the board that this is retaliation, not legitimate cause."

"And you think the board will care?" Bitterness leaked through. "They just sided with your father. They always side with money."

"Not always." Blake sat beside me. "Gregory Hamilton—Kit's father—he's furious. He's calling for a formal review. Other trustees are questioning whether this is appropriate use of donor authority."

"That's great. But it doesn't change that I have until Friday to pack my things and figure out where I go next."

Blake flinched. "I'll fix this. I promise."

"You can't promise that. Your father has power you don't have access to." I finally looked at him. "Blake, this is exactly what I was afraid of. Why I tried to walk away. Because I knew he'd destroy me to control you."

"Then we fight back. We don't just accept this."

"With what weapons? You're eighteen with no access to family money if your father cuts you off. I'm a scholarship student with no resources. What exactly are we fighting with?"

The question hung between us. Blake had determination and allies, but against William Ashford's institutional power and donor influence, was that enough?

---

Dr. Sullivan called an emergency meeting that afternoon with Michael Porter, Blake, and me.

"I won't sugarcoat this," she said once we'd gathered in her office. "The board has sided with William Ashford for now. But this decision is being challenged by several trustees who believe it represents donor overreach."

"What does that mean practically?" I asked.

"It means Gregory Hamilton has formally requested a full board review of the scholarship revocation. He's arguing that using financial aid as leverage to control a student's personal life violates school policy." Michael Porter pulled out documentation. "We have records of William's threats weeks before any alleged violation. That establishes this is retaliation, not academic concern."

"And if the board still sides with William?"

"Then we appeal to the state education board. Document this as abuse of institutional power." Dr. Sullivan's expression was determined. "Rachel, I won't let this stand without a fight. What William did is wrong."

"But fighting could take weeks. Months. And I'm supposed to leave Friday."

"We're asking for a stay on the revocation pending the full review," Michael said. "Keep you enrolled while the appeal process plays out."

Hope flickered, cautious and small. "You think that will work?"

"I think enough board members are uncomfortable with how this was handled that they'll approve a stay." Dr. Sullivan leaned forward. "William Ashford miscalculated. He thought he could quietly revoke your scholarship and no one would question it. But he did it so publicly, so clearly as retaliation for you attending winter formal with Blake, that even his allies are questioning whether he went too far."

"What do I do?"

"For now? Continue attending classes. Let us handle the institutional fight." She smiled slightly. "And know that you have more allies than William anticipated."

That evening, Emma helped me not pack.

"I'm not letting you give up," she said firmly when I started pulling out my suitcase. "Dr. Sullivan is fighting for you. Other board members are questioning this. You're not leaving."

"Emma—"

"No. You stood up to William Ashford. You went to that formal knowing the risks. You don't get to quit now just because he followed through on threats." She sat on my bed. "You get to see this fight through."

"I'm scared."

"Good. Be scared. But be scared while fighting, not while running away."

Blake texted: *My father came home furious. Gregory Hamilton called him. Board members are questioning the scholarship revocation. This is working.*

I wanted to believe him. Wanted to think institutional pushback would matter against William's power and money.

But I'd learned that hope was dangerous when you had everything to lose.

Tuesday morning, I went to class. Heads turned when I walked into English Literature. Everyone knew my scholarship had been revoked. Some looked sympathetic. Others looked like they thought I'd gotten what I deserved for reaching above my station.

Dr. Sullivan caught my eye and nodded—keep going, her expression said. You belong here.

Blake sat in his usual spot, three rows over. When our eyes met, he smiled. Small and worried, but real.

After class, Natalie cornered me in the hallway.

"You know this is your fault, right?" Her voice was cold. "Blake was fine until you got your hooks into him. Now his father is furious, his family is fighting, and you've made everything a mess."

"I didn't make Blake care about me. That's not something you can manufacture."

"Please. You saw an opportunity—rich boy, powerful family—and you took it. Don't pretend this is about feelings."

I could have argued. Could have defended myself. Instead I just looked at her—really looked.

"You're angry because Blake chose me," I said quietly. "Not because I'm wrong for him, but because you wanted him to choose you. And he didn't."

Natalie's face flushed. "He'll realize his mistake. Once you're gone and his father cuts him off, he'll see that you weren't worth it."

"Maybe." I shouldered my bag. "Or maybe he'll realize some things matter more than his father's approval. Either way, that's his choice to make. Not yours. Not his father's. His."

I walked away before she could respond, feeling stronger than I had since seeing that revocation letter.

Because Natalie was right about one thing—I had gotten my hooks into Blake. Not through manipulation or gold-digging, but through actual connection. Through late nights talking about literature and fear and dreams. Through seeing each other without pretense.

And that was worth fighting for, even if the odds were terrible.

Wednesday brought news.

The board had approved a stay on my scholarship revocation pending full review. I could remain enrolled while the appeal process played out.

Michael Porter delivered the news himself, grinning. "Gregory Hamilton argued that revoking aid without due process violates school policy. Other trustees agreed. You're staying, Rachel."

"For how long?"

"Until the full board review in three weeks. They'll examine all the evidence—your academic record, the timeline of William's threats, the circumstances of the revocation. And they'll vote on whether to uphold or reverse the decision."

I sat down, legs suddenly unsteady. "Three weeks."

"Three weeks to build our case. Dr. Sullivan is compiling documentation of your academic excellence. I have records of William's threats from weeks before the formal. Other students are willing to testify they witnessed the confrontation at winter formal." Michael's expression was serious but determined. "And Gregory Hamilton is personally reviewing the entire situation. He's... not pleased with how William handled this."

"Why is he helping?"

"Because he has a daughter. And he doesn't want to be part of a system that punishes students for who they care about." Michael smiled slightly. "Also, he thinks using donor authority to manipulate personal lives is, quote, 'exactly the kind of abuse of power that makes people hate the wealthy.' His words."

Three weeks. I had three weeks to prove my scholarship revocation was unjust retaliation, not legitimate cause.

Three weeks to fight William Ashford's power with nothing but truth and allies who believed in fairness.

It wasn't much. But it was more than I'd had Monday morning when that revocation letter arrived.

Blake found me after my meeting with Michael, pulled me into a quiet hallway, and hugged me tight.

"You're staying," he said into my hair.

"For now. Three weeks."

"Then we make those three weeks count." He pulled back to look at me. "My father made a mistake going after you so publicly. He thought institutional power would protect him. But he forgot that other people with power might actually care about doing what's right."

I wanted to believe him. And looking at Blake's fierce determination, feeling the solid support of faculty and even some board members, I let myself start to.

For the first time since seeing that revocation letter, I let myself actually hope.
