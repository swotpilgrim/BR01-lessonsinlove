# Chapter 2: An Opportunity

Tuesday afternoon classes dragged in the way they always did when I had something else on my mind. Dr. Sullivan's English class passed in a blur of discussion about symbolism in *Gatsby*, and I barely registered European history. My mind kept circling back to the tutoring position, calculating and recalculating what the extra money would mean.

Sixty-seven fifty a week. Times four weeks was two hundred seventy dollars a month. That could cover my textbook expenses for spring semester with money left over. Maybe enough to send something home to Mom for Christmas, let her work one less double shift in December.

By the time three-thirty rolled around, I'd talked myself through every possible version of the conversation I was about to have. What if Michael Porter had already filled the position? What if my application wasn't strong enough? What if there were a dozen other students more qualified than me?

The walk from Morrison Hall to Heritage Hall took exactly four minutes. I'd timed it my first week at Ashford. Four minutes wasn't enough time to calm my nerves.

Heritage Hall smelled like furniture polish and old money. Oil paintings of distinguished alumni lined the walls—men in suits from various decades, all looking stern and accomplished. I wondered how many of them had been scholarship students. Probably none.

The academic support office sat tucked in a corner on the second floor, between the registrar and the college counseling center. I'd walked past it dozens of times without really noticing it. The door stood open, and through it I could see a small waiting area that somehow managed to look both institutional and welcoming. Motivational posters covered the walls: "Believe in Yourself," "Growth Mindset," "Your Best Is Yet to Come."

A man in his early thirties sat at a desk just inside, surrounded by organized chaos—stacks of folders, coffee mugs, a dying succulent plant that someone had optimistically placed by the window. He wore a button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up and looked like he actually cared about his job.

I knocked on the doorframe, and he looked up.

"Hi," I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. "I'm looking for Michael Porter?"

"You found him." He looked up with a smile that seemed genuine, not the kind adults gave when they were being professionally pleasant. "What can I do for you?"

"I heard you're hiring tutors. I wanted to apply." The words came out faster than I intended. "Emma Bradford—she mentioned the position, and I thought I might be qualified."

"Emma." Michael's smile widened. "She's great. Come in, please, have a seat." He gestured to a chair across from his desk, moving a stack of folders to make room. "What's your name?"

"Rachel Winters. I'm a senior."

"Rachel Winters." He turned to his computer and typed something, then paused. His eyebrows rose as he scrolled. "Wow. 4.0 GPA, honor roll every semester, multiple academic achievement awards. You're working two campus jobs—bookstore and library?"

Heat crept up my neck. Compliments always made me uncomfortable, like someone might take them back if I acknowledged them. "Yes, sir. I work hard."

"I can see that." Michael leaned back in his chair, studying me with thoughtful brown eyes. "Can I be honest with you, Rachel?"

That phrase never preceded anything good. "Sure."

"The tutoring position pays well—fifteen dollars an hour, which I'm sure Emma mentioned—because it's reserved for a specific type of student. Students who are struggling academically despite having every resource available to them." He spoke carefully, like he was navigating a minefield. "Usually that means legacy students whose families have certain expectations but haven't necessarily noticed that their kids need actual support to succeed."

Translation: rich kids whose parents expected perfection without realizing their children were drowning.

"Sometimes those students can be... challenging," Michael continued. "They're not always gracious about needing help, especially from a peer. There can be ego involved, or embarrassment, or resentment. I want to make sure you understand what you might be walking into."

I understood perfectly. He was warning me that I'd be tutoring entitled legacy students who'd probably resent being taught by a scholarship student, someone they considered beneath them in the social hierarchy.

I'd dealt with worse. Three years at Ashford had given me thick skin when it came to casual cruelty and dismissal. At least this time I'd be getting paid for it.

"I can handle challenging," I said, meeting his eyes. "I've been handling it since I got here."

Something flickered across Michael's face—respect, maybe, or understanding.

"I believe you can. When can you start?"

Just like that? "Whenever you need me."

"How about Thursday evening? I've got a student who needs English literature help urgently, and based on your transcript, that's one of your strongest subjects." He pulled up another screen, scanning information I couldn't see. "He's bright—that's not the issue. But he's been avoiding the work, and now he's facing academic probation if his grades don't improve significantly this semester."

Academic probation. At Ashford Academy, where academic excellence was supposedly the baseline, that was practically unheard of. Whoever this student was, his parents were probably furious. Or maybe they didn't even know yet.

"What's the student's situation?" I asked. "Like, what specific help does he need?"

"Comprehension, analysis, essay writing—the full range of literature skills. He's currently failing Dr. Sullivan's English class, and she's the one who insisted he accept tutoring or face probation." Michael's expression suggested he had opinions about whatever was going on, but he was keeping them professional. "Dr. Sullivan specifically recommended you for this placement, actually. She said you're one of the best literature students she's taught in years."

Dr. Sullivan had recommended me? The woman who barely smiled and whose highest praise was usually a curt nod? I felt something warm expand in my chest, dangerously close to pride.

"Thursday works for me," I said. "What time?"

"Seven PM. We'll set you up in one of the private study rooms on the third floor of Morrison Library—quieter than down here, better for focused work. Plan for ninety-minute sessions, three times a week. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday to start, but we can adjust if that doesn't work for the student's schedule."

Ninety minutes, three times a week, at fifteen dollars an hour. The math clicked automatically in my head. Sixty-seven fifty weekly. Two hundred seventy monthly. Over two thousand dollars for the rest of the school year if I kept the position through May.

Life-changing money. Money that meant my mother could work fewer hours. Money that meant I wouldn't have to ration meal points or buy notebooks one at a time when I could afford them.

"That sounds perfect," I said, trying to keep the desperation out of my voice. "What do I need to prepare?"

"Just yourself and your teaching skills. I'll email you the details by tonight—study room number, student name, his specific weak points according to Dr. Sullivan's assessment." Michael smiled. "The first session is usually about establishing rapport and assessing exactly where the student is struggling. Don't feel like you need to fix everything in one night."

"Okay. Thank you. Really, thank you so much for this opportunity."

"You earned it, Rachel." He hesitated. "I'm an Ashford alum, by the way. Class of 2010. I was a scholarship student too."

That stopped me. The rolled-up sleeves, the genuine smile, the warnings—it all made sense now.

"How was it after?"

"Hard work, but worth it. I came back because I wanted to help students like us." He glanced at the folders on his desk. "The system isn't perfect, but we do what we can."

We talked logistics—progress reports, what to do if the student didn't show, who to contact with problems. Michael gave me a folder with payroll forms and tutoring guidelines. By the time I left, my bookbag was heavier but my steps felt lighter.

I practically flew down the stairs and out of Heritage Hall, crossing the quad toward my dorm.

The October afternoon was perfect—autumn colors blazing, students sprawled on the grass. For once, I didn't feel separate from the scene. For once, something good had happened.

I took the dormitory stairs two at a time. A girl with a laundry basket gave me an annoyed look, but I didn't care.

Emma was at her desk with calculus homework. She looked up when I burst in, her face breaking into a smile.

"You got it," she said. Not a question.

"I got it!" I dropped my bookbag and collapsed onto my bed. "Three sessions a week, ninety minutes each, fifteen dollars an hour."

"When do you start?"

"Thursday night. Seven PM." I sat up, grinning. "Michael Porter—the coordinator—he was really nice. He's an alum, a scholarship student like us."

"That's awesome." Emma's smile was genuine, but I saw the concern underneath. "Did he tell you who the student is?"

"Not yet. Emailing me tonight. All I know is he's failing Dr. Sullivan's English class and facing academic probation."

Emma's eyebrows rose. "Failing? At Ashford? His parents must be losing their minds."

"Right?" I lay back, staring at the water-stained ceiling. Our room was small and basic—two twin beds, two desks, one shared closet. But right now I felt like I could fly. "I have to email my mom. She'll be so relieved."

"Do it. Tell her your brilliant roommate gave you the tip." Emma grinned, then turned serious. "Rachel, I'm happy for you. But be careful, okay? Rich kids can be weird about accepting help. Especially from us."

"Michael warned me."

"Challenging is one thing. Cruel is another." Emma held my gaze. "Don't let whoever it is make you feel small. You're doing them a favor."

"I know." I'd spent three years at Ashford navigating invisible lines between scholarship and legacy. I knew how to keep my head down and my pride intact.

But right now, I didn't want to think about potential problems. I wanted to enjoy this moment—the first good thing that had happened in as long as I could remember.

Thursday felt both far away and dangerously close.

For now, I let myself feel hopeful.
