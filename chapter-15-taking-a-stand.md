# Chapter 15: Taking a Stand

The next morning, Blake was waiting outside Morrison Hall when I left for my eight o'clock shift at the bookstore.

He was leaning against his car, two coffee cups in hand, looking tired but determined. When he saw me, his face broke into a smile that made my heart skip.

"Good morning," he said, handing me a coffee.

"What are you doing here? It's seven-thirty."

"Walking my girlfriend to work." He said it casually, but his eyes were watching my reaction. "If that's okay?"

My girlfriend. The label made something warm bloom in my chest.

"That's very okay," I said.

Blake took my hand, interweaving our fingers, and we walked across campus together as the morning sun turned everything golden. Students hurried to early classes, most too focused on their coffee and assignments to notice us. But a few did double-takes—Blake Ashford III holding hands with the scholarship girl wasn't exactly subtle.

At the bookstore, Blake kissed me goodbye. Not hidden, not rushed, but right there in front of the windows where anyone could see.

"I'll see you at lunch?" he asked.

"You don't have to—"

"I want to. Dining hall, noon. We can sit together."

"Blake, that's going to draw attention."

"Good." His expression was resolute. "I meant what I said last night. No more hiding. I choose you, and I want everyone to know it."

He kissed me again, then headed toward his morning economics class, leaving me standing there feeling simultaneously terrified and cherished.

Emma found me during my break, bursting into the bookstore with wide eyes.

"Is it true?" she demanded.

"Is what true?"

"That you and Blake Ashford are officially together? Because Madison saw you two walking across campus holding hands, and Jordan said Blake kissed you in front of the bookstore, and everyone is talking about it."

My stomach dropped. "Everyone?"

"Rachel, Blake Ashford doesn't do public displays of affection with anyone, much less scholarship students. This is news." Emma studied my face. "So it's true? You're together?"

"Yes. He chose me. Us. Even if his father cuts him off."

Emma's expression softened. "Oh, Rachel. I hope he means it."

"He does."

"Then I'm happy for you. Really." She hugged me tight. "Just be prepared. The legacy students aren't going to take this well."

She was right.

By lunchtime, the whispers had intensified. When I walked into the dining hall, conversations stopped. Eyes tracked my movement across the room. I felt every gaze like a weight.

Blake was already there, sitting at a neutral table—not in the legacy section, not in the scholarship section, but somewhere in between. Kit sat with him, and they were deep in conversation when I approached.

"Hey," Blake said, standing immediately and pulling out a chair for me. The gesture was so publicly attentive that several nearby students stared. "Rachel, you remember Kit."

"Hi, Rachel." Kit smiled, and it seemed genuine. "Congratulations. Blake told me you two are official now."

"Thanks," I said, sitting down and trying to ignore the scrutiny from every direction.

Blake sat close, his hand finding mine under the table. "I was just telling Kit that I'm applying for financial aid. My father's cutting me off."

Kit's expression was sympathetic. "He really went through with it?"

"Email came this morning. Effective immediately. No more tuition payments, no allowance, no funding for business school applications." Blake's voice was matter-of-fact, but I could hear the hurt underneath. "He gave me one last chance to 'come to my senses and end this inappropriate relationship.' I declined."

My chest felt tight. "Blake—"

"It's done, Rachel. I made my choice." He squeezed my hand. "No regrets."

But I could see the cost in his eyes. Losing his family, his financial security, everything he'd always known—it was huge. And he was doing it for us.

We were finishing lunch when Natalie Brennan approached our table, flanked by two other legacy students. Her smile was sharp and cruel.

"Blake, can I talk to you? Privately?"

"No," Blake said simply.

Natalie blinked, clearly not expecting refusal. "It's about your father. He called my parents last night—"

"Then it's family business, and I'm not discussing family business with you."

"I'm trying to help. Your father is worried about you making impulsive decisions that could ruin your future." Her eyes flicked to me. "Decisions you might regret."

"The only thing I regret," Blake said, his voice carrying across the now-silent dining hall, "is not standing up to people like you sooner."

Natalie's smile froze. "Excuse me?"

Blake stood, and I felt the shift in energy. Everyone was watching now, conversations stopped, all attention focused on our table.

"For months, I've watched you and your friends make cutting comments about scholarship students. About Rachel specifically. I stayed silent because it was easier, because I didn't want to rock the boat, because I was a coward."

"Blake—"

"I'm not finished." His voice was calm but firm. "You've mocked Rachel for working hard, for earning her place here through actual merit instead of family legacy. You've treated her like she's less than you because her mother works as a nurse instead of sitting on charity boards. You've made her life difficult because she dared to exist in your space."

Natalie's face was flushed, her confident mask cracking. "I never—"

"Yes, you did. We all did. The whole legacy crowd treats scholarship students like they're charity cases who should be grateful for the privilege of attending Ashford. It's cruel and it's wrong, and I should have said something the first time I heard it."

The dining hall was completely silent. I could feel dozens of eyes on us, but Blake's attention was entirely on Natalie.

"Rachel has worked harder than anyone at this school. She works two jobs, maintains a 4.0 GPA, and still finds time to tutor students like me who can't read without struggling. She's brilliant and kind and she's earned every single thing she has. She deserves respect, not mockery."

"So you're defending her because you're dating her," Natalie said, but her voice lacked its usual confidence.

"I'm defending her because it's right. Because she shouldn't have to defend herself against people who were born with advantages and act like they earned them." Blake's eyes swept the dining hall, meeting gazes from both legacy and scholarship students. "And I'm ashamed it took me this long to see it."

He turned to me, his expression softening. "Rachel, I'm sorry. For every time I stayed silent. For every moment I let them make you feel less than. For being part of the problem."

My eyes were burning, my throat tight. "Blake—"

He looked back at Natalie. "We're done here. And for the record—my relationship with Rachel isn't a mistake or an impulsive decision. It's the best choice I've ever made. So you can tell my father, your parents, and anyone else who's interested that I'm not changing my mind."

Natalie stared at him for a long moment, then turned and left without another word, her friends hurrying after her.

The dining hall erupted in whispers.

Blake sat back down, reaching for my hand. "Was that okay?" he asked quietly. "I know you can fight your own battles, but I needed to say it. For me as much as for you."

"That was..." I couldn't find words. My eyes were wet, my heart too full. "That was perfect."

Kit was grinning. "Damn, Blake. Didn't know you had that in you."

"Neither did I," Blake admitted. He looked at me, his thumb tracing circles on my hand. "But Rachel makes me braver."

We left the dining hall together, Blake's hand in mine, walking through the stares and whispers with our heads high. Word would spread quickly—Blake Ashford had publicly chosen the scholarship girl, had defended her against his own social circle, had stood up to Natalie Brennan in front of everyone.

There would be consequences. His father would escalate. The legacy students would probably make things more difficult. The scholarship students would have their own opinions about us crossing social boundaries.

But as we walked across the quad in the January sunshine, I felt something I hadn't felt since arriving at Ashford: hope.

"Your father's going to be furious," I said.

"Probably. He'll call, make threats, try to force me back into line."

"Are you scared?"

Blake stopped walking, turning to face me. "Terrified. I've never gone against my father like this. Never chosen something he didn't approve of. I don't know how to do this without his support."

"You're already doing it."

"Because of you." He pulled me closer. "Rachel, I know this is going to be hard. I know we'll face pressure from every direction. But I meant every word I said in there. You're the best choice I've ever made."

"Even if it costs you everything?"

"It's not costing me everything. It's costing me money and my father's approval. But I'm gaining something so much more important." He cupped my face with both hands. "I'm gaining a life I actually choose. A relationship built on real connection instead of social obligation. A future I actually want."

"What if it's too hard? What if—"

He kissed me, soft and sure and full of promise. When we pulled apart, he was smiling.

"Then it's too hard and we'll figure it out anyway. Together. That's what we agreed, right? No more running, no more avoiding. We face everything together."

"Together," I agreed.

As we stood there in the middle of campus, Blake Ashford's arms around me, I let myself believe it. That love could be enough. That choosing each other could work despite the odds. That standing up for what mattered could make a difference.

Blake had taken a stand—publicly, unmistakably, in front of everyone who'd doubted us.

And I was ready to stand with him, whatever came next.
