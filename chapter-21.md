# Chapter 21: Forced Apart

December settled over Ashford like a cold weight.

Students returned from Thanksgiving break energized and chattering about holiday plans, winter formal preparations, and final exams. The campus buzzed with activity—but for me, it all felt muted and distant.

Blake and I avoided each other.

Not obviously. We were too smart for that. But where we'd once found reasons to cross paths, now we found reasons not to. I took different routes to class. He stopped coming to the library during my shifts. In Dr. Sullivan's English class, we sat on opposite sides of the room and never made eye contact.

It was excruciating.

Blake had been assigned a new tutor—Marcus Chen, a senior from his social circle who was heading to Princeton. I saw them sometimes in the library study rooms, Blake's posture rigid and disengaged in a way I recognized. Marcus was competent but uninvested, going through the motions for the paycheck.

Blake's grades started slipping again. I heard Dr. Sullivan comment on it after class one day, concern in her voice. But there was nothing I could do. Helping Blake meant risking everything, and William Ashford had made the consequences very clear.

"You look miserable," Emma said one evening in our dorm room. I was lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling instead of doing homework.

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You've been not fine for two weeks." Emma set down her textbook. "Rachel, I know this is hard. But maybe... maybe it gets easier?"

"Does it?" I rolled onto my side to face her. "Because it feels like it's getting worse."

Emma's expression was sympathetic. "Have you talked to him at all?"

"No. That's the point. Talking to Blake gives his father ammunition." I pulled my blanket tighter. "Michael Porter told me to maintain professional boundaries. Not talking is about as professional as it gets."

"But you're both miserable."

"Better miserable than me losing my scholarship."

Emma couldn't argue with that. Neither could I. But knowing something was necessary didn't make it hurt less.

I saw Blake in the dining hall sometimes. He'd be sitting with Kit and the usual legacy crowd, Natalie positioned strategically close to him. She'd been increasingly proprietary since Thanksgiving, touching his arm during conversations, laughing too loudly at his comments. Staking her claim.

Blake never looked happy about it, but he didn't push her away either. I told myself it was better this way. He was going back to his world, the one he actually belonged in. The one where scholarship girls didn't complicate things.

But late at night, I'd remember his voice reading Keats. The way he'd looked at me before we almost kissed. His hand warm on mine in the falling snow.

And I'd feel the loss all over again.

"Rachel Winters?" Dr. Sullivan's voice caught me after English class one Thursday.

I approached her desk warily. "Yes?"

"Walk with me." It wasn't a request.

We left Heritage Hall together, Dr. Sullivan setting a brisk pace across the quad. Snow crunched under our feet.

"I'm concerned about Blake," she said without preamble. "His work has regressed significantly since Thanksgiving. He was doing so well, and now..." She gestured frustration. "It's like he's given up."

"I'm not his tutor anymore," I said carefully. "Marcus Chen is."

"Yes. I'm aware." Dr. Sullivan gave me a sharp look. "I'm also aware that Blake's regression coincided with your tutoring arrangement ending. Would you like to tell me what happened?"

"It was determined that a different arrangement would be more appropriate."

"By whom?"

I stayed silent. Dr. Sullivan was perceptive and caring, but she couldn't fight William Ashford any more than I could.

"I see." Her voice was tight. "Rachel, I want you to know that if there are... external pressures affecting your academic environment, my door is always open."

"Thank you, Dr. Sullivan."

She stopped walking, turning to face me directly. "You're a remarkable student with a bright future. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise. And don't let anyone use power inappropriately to control your choices."

The words felt pointed. Deliberate. Like she knew exactly what had happened and was offering what support she could within her limitations.

"I won't," I promised, though we both knew I already had.

Dr. Sullivan nodded, then continued toward her office. I stood in the cold for a moment, watching her go.

Another person who saw the injustice but couldn't stop it. Another reminder that William Ashford's power extended beyond his son, shaping everything in its sphere of influence.

I headed back to my dorm, trying not to look at the legacy wing as I passed. Trying not to wonder if Blake was in there, as miserable as I was.

The winter formal was two weeks away. The entire campus was talking about it—who was going with whom, what people were wearing, which band was playing. Natalie made sure everyone knew she and Blake were going together, announcing it loudly at lunch one day.

Blake hadn't confirmed it, but he hadn't denied it either. And silence, at Ashford, was as good as agreement.

Emma tried to convince me to go to the formal. "You could go with the other scholarship students. We could all go together, make it fun."

"And watch Blake there with Natalie? No thank you."

"So you're just going to hide in the dorm all night?"

"I'm going to work." I'd already picked up an extra shift helping with formal setup and cleanup. The money was good, and it gave me an excuse to stay busy. "Someone has to."

Emma looked like she wanted to argue, but she let it drop.

Kit approached me one afternoon in the library. I was restocking shelves, lost in thought, when his voice startled me.

"Rachel? Can I talk to you for a minute?"

I turned to find Blake's best friend looking uncomfortable and uncertain—unusual for someone usually so confident in his place at Ashford.

"If this is about Blake—"

"It is." Kit glanced around, making sure we were alone. "Look, I know it's not my business. But Blake is... he's not okay."

"I can't help him. You know why."

"Because his father threatened your scholarship. Yeah, Blake told me." Kit's expression was unusually serious. "That's really messed up, for what it's worth. Using institutional power against a student like that."

"But it's effective." I returned a book to its shelf with more force than necessary. "Your family has that kind of power too, doesn't it? Board influence, donor weight?"

"Yeah." He had the grace to look uncomfortable. "Never really thought about how that must feel from the other side."

"Most people don't."

Kit was quiet for a moment. "Blake's not going to ask, because he doesn't want to make things worse for you. But I think you should know—he's barely sleeping. His grades are tanking. And Natalie..." Kit made a face. "She's circling like a shark."

"Then maybe he should go to the formal with her. Keep his father happy." The words tasted bitter.

"Is that really what you want?"

"What I want doesn't matter." I met Kit's eyes. "What matters is me finishing senior year and getting into college. Blake will be fine. He's Blake Ashford III. He's always fine."

"Except when he's not." Kit backed away. "Just... think about it, okay?"

He left before I could respond. I stood there among the bookshelves, Kit's words echoing in my mind.

Blake wasn't fine. But neither was I. And William Ashford had made sure we'd both suffer separately rather than find comfort together.

That night, I dreamed about the library study room. Blake reading Keats, snowfall outside the windows, the moment before we almost kissed. In the dream, no one interrupted. His lips met mine, warm and real, and everything felt possible.

I woke up to darkness and Emma's steady breathing, the dream fading into cold reality. Blake was probably in the legacy wing, thinking about winter formal with Natalie. And I was here, alone, protected by distance that felt like punishment.

Two more weeks until winter formal. Two more weeks of careful avoidance, of pretending the person I cared about was just another student in my English class. Two more weeks of choosing survival over my heart.

I could do it. I had to do it.

Even if it was slowly killing me.

The next morning, I passed Blake in the hallway between classes. Our eyes met for just a second—long enough to see the same misery I felt reflected back at me. Then we looked away, kept walking, maintained the careful distance that kept my scholarship safe and his father satisfied.

And I hated every second of it.

But I kept walking. Because that was the deal William Ashford had offered: my education for my feelings. My future for my heart.

And I'd chosen the only choice I could afford to make.

Even if it left me feeling hollowed out and alone, watching snow fall on Ashford Academy and remembering when that snow had meant hope instead of loss.
