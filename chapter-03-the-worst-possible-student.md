# Chapter 3: The Worst Possible Student

Thursday evening arrived too quickly and not quickly enough. I'd checked Michael's email approximately fifty times since Tuesday. Study Room 3C, third floor of Morrison Library. Seven PM sharp. Student name: Blake Ashford III.

Blake Ashford III. Founding family, legacy wing, old money. I'd seen him in Dr. Sullivan's class, coasting on charm.

Great.

But sixty-seven fifty a week was sixty-seven fifty a week. I could be professional. I could teach anyone.

I arrived at Study Room 3C ten minutes early. The third floor of Morrison Library was quiet, designed for serious study. Small rooms lined the corridor, each with a table and chairs.

I arranged my materials—my annotated copy of *The Great Gatsby*, notebook paper, extra pens, discussion questions. I'd prepared analysis exercises, strategies for breaking down complex texts.

I was ready. Professional.

At exactly seven PM, footsteps sounded in the hallway.

The door opened.

Blake Ashford III walked in, and both of us froze.

His expression shifted from confident to horrified. For a long moment, we just stared.

"You're kidding me," Blake said. "You're my tutor?"

My stomach sank, but I kept my face neutral. "Hello, Blake. I'm Rachel Winters. I'll be working with you this semester."

"No." He shook his head. "There's been a mistake. I asked for a tutor, not—" He stopped, but I knew what he meant. Not a scholarship student.

"Not a mistake. Michael Porter assigned me based on my academic record and Dr. Sullivan's recommendation. Three sessions per week. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday."

Blake stood in the doorway, weighing his options. Accept help from the scholarship girl, or face academic probation.

Finally, he stepped in and shut the door. "This is confidential, right? No one needs to know about this?"

Of course. Embarrassed to be seen with me. "Everything discussed here is confidential. Though Michael receives progress reports."

"Fine." Blake dropped his bookbag on the table and sat down, sprawling like he owned the place. Which his family kind of did. "Let's get this over with."

I sat down, arranging materials between us. He hadn't brought anything—no books, no notebooks, no pens.

"Did you bring *The Great Gatsby*?"

"No."

"Notebook? Something to write with?"

"I didn't know I needed to."

I slid my extra notebook and pen across. "You'll need these for every session. And the texts we're studying."

Blake picked up the pen like it was an insult. "Anything else?"

I fought down irritation. Michael had warned me. Challenging students. "Let's start with assessing where you are. You're studying *Gatsby*. What specific areas are you struggling with?"

"I'm not struggling. Dr. Sullivan just has unrealistic expectations."

"You're facing academic probation."

"That's an exaggeration."

"Michael said you're failing."

Blake's jaw tightened. "Dr. Sullivan doesn't appreciate different learning styles."

Translation: he hadn't been doing the work.

"Let's approach this differently. There's a major paper due before Thanksgiving. Have you started?"

"Not yet."

"Have you completed the reading?"

"Most of it."

That meant no. "Have you done any of the reading?"

Blake's expression turned cold. "I've skimmed it. I know the plot."

"Literature analysis requires more than plot. Dr. Sullivan's papers need close reading, textual evidence, sophisticated interpretation."

"I know how to analyze literature. I just don't find *Gatsby* interesting."

"You still need to pass." I pulled my copy closer. "Chapter one. What does it establish?"

"Nick moves to New York. He meets Gatsby. Rich people have problems."

"That's plot. What about themes? Narrative voice? Symbolism?"

Blake shrugged. "American Dream. Rich people are unhappy. The usual."

"Can you point to specific passages?"

"I don't have the book."

I turned my copy so we could both see it. "Look at the opening. Nick's father's advice: 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' What is Fitzgerald doing?"

Blake glanced at it. "Establishing Nick's character?"

"What is he saying about advantage and judgment?"

"That rich people have it easier?"

"More nuanced. Nick's father warns him about judging while acknowledging Nick's advantages. It sets up Nick's position as both insider and outsider." I looked at Blake. "Does that remind you of anything?"

His face was blank. "Should it?"

"Think about your position at Ashford. You have advantages—family legacy, resources. How does that affect how you see the world?"

Blake's expression hardened. "Is this tutoring or therapy?"

"Literary analysis. Understanding a text means connecting it to larger ideas about society, class, power."

"Maybe Dr. Sullivan expects too much."

"Or maybe you're not putting in the work."

The words came out sharper than I intended. Blake's eyes narrowed.

"Excuse me?"

I should have backed off, should have stayed professional and patient. But I'd spent three years watching students like Blake coast while I worked myself to exhaustion. I'd spent three years being invisible or dismissed or treated like I didn't belong. And now I was supposed to gently coax him through material he couldn't be bothered to actually read?

"You haven't done the reading," I said, my voice harder now. "You haven't started the paper. You don't even know what chapters we're currently studying. You're not struggling with Dr. Sullivan's expectations—you're struggling because you're not doing the basic work."

Blake stood up abruptly, his chair scraping loudly against the floor. "And who are you to judge that?"

"I'm your tutor. Assessing your current level is part of my job."

"Your job." He laughed, but it wasn't a pleasant sound. "Right. Because you need this, don't you? The extra money. Another scholarship student working extra jobs to afford to be here."

The contempt in his voice made my hands clench under the table. "Yes, I work for what I have. Novel concept for you, I'm sure."

"At least I don't take myself so seriously. At least I'm not some charity case acting superior because I memorized a few books."

Charity case.

The words landed like a slap. I'd been called worse—usually behind my back, sometimes to my face, always with that same dismissive tone that suggested I was less than, that I didn't belong, that I should be grateful just to be breathing the same rarefied air as the legacy students.

But hearing it from Blake, right now, after I'd prepared so carefully to help him, after I'd been professional despite my own feelings about entitled legacy students like him—it stung worse than it should have.

I stood up too, gathering my materials with sharp, angry movements. "This session is over."

"We still have an hour left," Blake said, and now he looked uncertain, like maybe he realized he'd gone too far.

"I'm not going to sit here and be insulted. If you want tutoring, you show up prepared, you do the work, and you treat me with basic respect. If you can't manage that, you can face academic probation on your own." I shoved my books into my bag. "Think about whether you actually want help or whether you just want someone to blame for your own laziness."

"I'm not lazy—"

"You didn't even bring a notebook," I snapped. "You haven't read the book. You can't answer basic questions about themes or analysis. That's not a learning style difference. That's just not trying."

I headed for the door, but Blake stepped in front of it. Not blocking me exactly, but close enough that I had to stop.

"Michael Porter will make me keep coming to these sessions," he said. "My father will make sure of it."

"Then I guess you'll be here Monday," I said coldly. "And I guess you'll decide between now and then whether you're going to actually accept help or whether you're going to keep wasting both our time."

"This isn't a waste of time—"

"Yes, it is. I just spent forty-five minutes trying to get you to engage with basic literary analysis, and you couldn't even pretend to care. I've got better things to do than force-feed education to someone who thinks he's above it."

Blake's face flushed with anger. "You don't know anything about me."

"I know you're failing English. I know you show up unprepared. I know you'd rather insult me than admit you might actually need help." I adjusted the bag on my shoulder. "Now if you'll excuse me, I'm leaving."

He stepped aside, and I walked out without looking back.

The hallway was empty, my footsteps echoing too loud in the quiet library. I took the stairs down two at a time, my heart pounding with anger and frustration and something that felt uncomfortably like hurt.

Charity case. Like I was something to be pitied or dismissed. Like my hard work and perfect grades didn't matter because I hadn't been born with a trust fund and a family name.

I burst out of Morrison Library into the October evening. The quad was mostly empty at this hour, just a few students crossing toward the dormitories. The air was cold enough to bite, and I welcomed it, letting it cool the angry heat in my face.

Sixty-seven fifty a week. That's what I'd been thinking about. The money that would help my mother, that would ease the constant financial pressure.

But was it worth this? Worth being treated like I was less than nothing by someone who'd never worked for anything in his life?

I didn't know.

All I knew was that Blake Ashford was the worst possible student I could have been assigned, and Monday's session was going to be a nightmare.
