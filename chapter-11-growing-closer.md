# Chapter 11: Growing Closer

Thanksgiving break came and went. I spent it in Burlington with my mom, who noticed immediately that something had changed.

"You're different," she said over leftover turkey sandwiches. "Happier. Did something good happen at school?"

I told her about the tutoring job and the extra money. I didn't tell her about Blake. Not yet. Not when I wasn't sure what we were or where this was going.

But when I returned to campus, Blake was waiting.

He texted me the moment I got back: *Coffee? I missed you*

Three words that made my heart race.

We met at the campus café, and the moment I saw him, I knew Emma had been right to worry. I was in deep. Deeper than I'd ever meant to be.

"Hey," Blake said, standing when I approached. He pulled me into a hug that lasted just a beat too long to be casual. "How was your break?"

"Good. Quiet. Yours?"

Blake's expression darkened slightly. "Tense. My father had opinions about my improved English grade."

"Opinions?"

"He thinks Dr. Sullivan is going easy on me now. That an A-minus isn't a real achievement, just grade inflation." Blake's jaw tightened. "He can't conceive that I actually earned it."

I reached for his hand across the table. "You did earn it. I saw the work you put in."

"I know. You know. Dr. Sullivan knows." He exhaled slowly. "But my father will never see me as capable of actual academic success in humanities. It doesn't fit his narrative."

"His narrative is wrong."

"Yeah." Blake smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. "Anyway. I don't want to talk about my father. I want to hear about your Thanksgiving."

So I told him—about my mom's small apartment, about working a shift at her hospital's cafeteria to help out, about quiet evenings watching old movies and eating leftovers. It wasn't glamorous, but it was real.

Blake listened like every detail mattered. And maybe to him, it did.

December brought finals and stress and long nights in the library. Blake and I fell into a rhythm—tutoring sessions that blurred into study dates, coffee runs that turned into stolen kisses in empty library stacks, moments of connection scattered between academic pressure.

I'd never dated anyone seriously before. There had been a boy back home sophomore year, but it fizzled after a few weeks. Blake was different. Blake was intense and consuming and wonderful in ways that terrified me.

He'd show up at my dorm with coffee when I had early shifts at the bookstore. He'd text me literary jokes that only made sense because of our tutoring sessions. He'd find me studying in the library late at night and sit beside me in comfortable silence, both of us working on our respective assignments, our feet touching under the table.

Emma observed all this with a mixture of happiness and concern. "He's really into you," she said one night, watching me smile at my phone. "I just hope his father doesn't ruin it."

"Blake says his father doesn't control his life."

"Blake is eighteen and financially dependent on his father. That's a lot of control whether he admits it or not."

I knew she was right. But I didn't want to think about it.

Dr. Sullivan assigned a final paper on *Pride and Prejudice*. Blake groaned when she announced it.

"More romance and social class commentary," he said after class, but he was smiling. "She's really committed to the theme."

"You'll do fine. You understand this stuff now."

"Because you taught me." Blake caught my hand as we walked out of Heritage Hall, interweaving our fingers. Students passing by noticed—some with curiosity, some with judgment, some with indifference. "Elizabeth and Darcy, right? Initial prejudice, eventual understanding, love conquering class differences?"

"That's... actually a perfect summary."

"See? I'm learning." He grinned, pulling me closer as we walked through the December cold. "Plus it's basically our story. You thought I was a privileged asshole. I thought you were a judgmental scholarship student. Turns out we were both wrong."

"Are we Elizabeth and Darcy now?"

"I mean, I'm definitely proud and you're definitely prejudiced, so..."

I shoved him playfully, and he laughed, catching me around the waist and pulling me into a quick kiss that made several passing students do double-takes.

"You're impossible."

"You like me anyway."

I did. I more than liked him, which was both wonderful and terrifying.

Our relationship became an open secret. We didn't hide it, but we didn't advertise it either. Blake would find me studying in the library and join me, settling into the chair beside me with his own work. I'd save him a seat in Dr. Sullivan's class, ignoring the raised eyebrows from other students. We'd grab dinner together at the dining hall, sitting at neutral tables instead of legacy or scholarship designated areas.

The first time Blake held my hand in public—walking across the quad in front of everyone—my heart nearly stopped. This was declaring something. Making us visible in a way that invited judgment and commentary.

But Blake just smiled at me and didn't let go, even when Natalie Brennan walked past with her friends and made a pointed comment about "interesting combinations."

People noticed. Legacy students whispered behind hands, speculating about what Blake Ashford III was doing with the scholarship girl. Scholarship students raised eyebrows, some supportive, some warning me not to get too comfortable in a world that wasn't mine. But Blake didn't seem to care, and that made me brave enough not to care either.

Most of the time.

Kit pulled me aside one day after class.

"Hey, Rachel. Can I talk to you for a minute?"

I tensed, expecting... I wasn't sure what. Warnings about Blake? Judgment about dating outside my social class?

Instead, Kit smiled. "I just wanted to say thanks. Blake's different lately. Better. Less stressed, more genuinely happy. That's because of you."

"Oh. I—thank you?"

"He's had a rough time with his family, with academic pressure. You've been good for him." Kit hesitated. "Just... be patient with him, okay? If things get complicated. His father has very specific ideas about who Blake should date, and scholarship students don't fit the profile."

My stomach dropped. "Has his father said something?"

"Not yet. But he will, eventually. Just giving you a heads up." Kit's expression was kind, apologetic. "Blake's crazy about you. I think he'd choose you over his father's approval. But that choice might be harder than he expects."

After Kit left, I sat in the empty classroom trying to process. I'd known dating Blake came with complications. But hearing it stated so plainly—that Blake's father would disapprove, that Blake might have to choose—made it feel suddenly real and dangerous.

Emma found me there twenty minutes later.

"I've been looking everywhere for you. What happened?"

I told her about Kit's warning. Emma's expression turned grim.

"I hate that I was right about this."

"You haven't been right yet. Blake hasn't chosen his father over me."

"But will he? When it comes down to it?"

I didn't have an answer.

That evening's tutoring session felt different. Blake noticed immediately.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing. Let's just work on your *Pride and Prejudice* analysis."

"Rachel." He reached across the table, taking both my hands. "Talk to me."

So I did. I told him about Kit's warning, about my fears that Blake's father would force him to choose, about wondering if I was setting myself up for inevitable heartbreak.

Blake listened without interrupting. When I finished, he was quiet for a long moment.

"My father doesn't control my life," he said finally. "He thinks he does, but he doesn't. I get to choose who I date. Who I care about."

"And if he threatens to cut you off? Pull your funding?"

"Then I'll figure it out. The same way you do. The same way students without trust funds do." Blake squeezed my hands. "Rachel, I know this is complicated. I know my world and your world aren't supposed to mix. But I don't care about supposed to. I care about you."

"Blake—"

"I'm falling for you. Maybe already fell, I don't know. But whatever this is, whatever we are—it's real to me. It matters." His eyes were intense, honest. "Does it matter to you?"

"Yes," I whispered. "It matters."

"Then we'll figure out the rest. Together."

He kissed me then, soft and sure and full of promise. When we pulled apart, we were both smiling despite the heavy conversation.

"Okay," I said. "Together."

"Together," Blake agreed.

We tried to focus on the *Pride and Prejudice* paper after that, but our hearts weren't in academic analysis. Instead, we talked about everything else—finals week stress, winter break plans, what would happen when we came back in January.

"I wish I could spend break with you," Blake said. "Instead of at my father's house pretending to care about business networking events."

"I wish that too. But I need to work." I'd already lined up extra shifts at my mom's hospital cafeteria, trying to earn money for spring semester expenses.

"Will you text me? Even if it's just to complain about terrible customers or boring shifts?"

"If you text me from whatever fancy networking events you're forced to attend."

"Deal." Blake grinned. "I'll send you pictures of overstuffed suits talking about stock portfolios."

"And I'll send you pictures of hospital cafeteria mystery meat."

"We're disgustingly cute, aren't we?"

"Completely disgusting."

But I wouldn't have changed it for anything.

When the session ended, Blake walked me back to my dorm through the December snow. The campus was beautiful—lights strung along pathways, snow making everything look like a postcard.

"I'm really glad you were assigned as my tutor," Blake said as we reached Morrison Hall. "Even though I was terrible to you at first."

"You weren't that terrible."

"I called you a charity case."

"Okay, you were pretty terrible." I smiled to show I was teasing. "But you got better."

"Because you gave me a chance. You could have quit after that first session, reported that I was unteachable, gotten assigned to someone else. But you didn't."

"I needed the money too badly to quit."

"No, you're just stubborn and refused to let me fail." Blake cupped my face with both hands. "Thank you. For believing in me. For teaching me. For seeing past the defensive asshole to whoever I actually am."

"You're a pretty great whoever-you-actually-are."

He kissed me then, slow and sweet and perfect, snowflakes falling around us like something out of a movie.

And for that moment, standing in the snow with Blake Ashford III holding me like I was precious, I let myself forget about disapproving fathers and class divides and all the reasons this was complicated.

For that moment, it was just us.

And that was enough.
