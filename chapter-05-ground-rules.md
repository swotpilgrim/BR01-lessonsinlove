# Chapter 5: Ground Rules

I arrived at Study Room 3C at six fifty-five Monday evening, determined to be professional.

Whatever Blake thought of me didn't matter. I had a job to do, and I needed the money too badly to let pride interfere. I'd be calm, patient, educational.

I arranged my materials—*Gatsby* with fresh annotations, comprehension questions, extra paper and pens. I'd even printed a guide to literary analysis.

I was prepared. Professional.

Seven PM came and went.

I sat watching the clock tick past seven-oh-five, seven-oh-ten, seven-fifteen. The library was busy—midterms approaching, everyone cramming.

Everyone except Blake.

The door opened.

Blake walked in from crew practice—hair damp, Athletics hoodie. He dropped his bag and sat down.

"Sorry. Practice ran long."

I looked at him, fighting down irritation. Testing boundaries. "You're twenty minutes late. Our sessions are ninety minutes. You just lost twenty."

Blake shrugged. "I can't control when practice ends."

"You could have texted to let us know. Or left practice on time."

"Crew is important—"

"This tutoring is mandatory," I interrupted. "If you don't take it seriously, you face academic probation. So let's establish ground rules."

Blake leaned back. "Ground rules."

I wrote while I talked. "One: Arrive on time, or text at least thirty minutes in advance. Two: Come prepared—bring texts, something to write with, complete assigned reading. Three: Participate actively. Actually do the work."

I slid the paper across. "Non-negotiable. If you can't follow them, I report lack of progress to Michael."

Blake stared at it. "You're serious."

"Completely. I can't help you if you don't show up on time and put in effort."

"I put in effort—"

"Do you? Last session you showed up without materials, hadn't read, couldn't answer basic questions. That's not effort."

Blake's jaw tightened, but he didn't argue.

"Fine," he said finally. "Your ground rules. Can we start now?"

I ignored the sarcasm. "Did you bring *The Great Gatsby* this time?"

He hesitated, then pulled a book from his bag. The school edition, pages still crisp like it had barely been opened. "Yes."

"Something to write with?"

He found a pen.

Small victories. "Good. Let's start by assessing where you actually are with the reading. We're currently on chapter four. Can you summarize what happens in that chapter?"

Blake flipped through the book like he was looking for answers hidden in the margins. "Tom and Daisy have a party. Nick meets people. There's... a lot of talking."

"That's chapter three," I said. "Chapter four is where Nick rides into New York with Gatsby and learns about his past from Jordan. Can you tell me what Jordan reveals about Gatsby and Daisy?"

Blake's expression went carefully blank. "That they knew each other before."

"More specific. What's their history?"

"They were... involved?"

"Blake." I kept my voice patient, even though I wanted to scream. "Did you actually read chapter four?"

"I skimmed it."

"When?"

"Over the weekend."

"And you retained nothing." It wasn't a question.

His face flushed with anger or embarrassment—I couldn't tell which. "I retained the basic plot. Gatsby and Daisy knew each other. There's history. That's the important part."

"The important part is the details—how they met, why they separated, what Gatsby's been doing for five years, how this history drives his current actions. Those details are what let you analyze Fitzgerald's commentary on class and aspiration." I pulled my copy of *Gatsby* closer. "Let's try this differently. Can you read aloud from chapter four? Starting here." I pointed to the passage where Jordan begins telling Gatsby's history.

Blake looked at the page for a long moment. "Why do I need to read aloud? I'm not in elementary school."

"Because I need to assess how you're engaging with the text. Please start reading."

He looked like he wanted to refuse. But he'd already lost the battle over ground rules, and maybe he was smart enough to know he couldn't push back on everything.

Blake began reading, his voice flat and reluctant. "'It was a strange coincidence,' I said. 'But it wasn't a coincidence at all.' 'Why not?' 'Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.'"

He stumbled over "coincidence," paused too long between sentences, and his inflection suggested he wasn't processing meaning—just saying words.

"Keep going," I said quietly.

Blake continued, but it got worse. He mispronounced "colossal," hesitated over "inexplicable," and completely mangled "turbulent." His confidence was cracking with every mistake, his voice growing quieter, more defensive.

I let him read for a full page before I stopped him. "Thank you. You can stop there."

Blake closed the book like he was relieved to be done. His face was flushed, his shoulders tight.

I chose my words carefully. "Blake, do you have trouble with reading? Not comprehension—the actual act of reading?"

"No," he said immediately. Too quickly. Too defensively.

"Because if you do, there are resources that can help. We could get you tested for—"

"I don't have a learning disability." His voice was sharp. "I just don't like reading aloud. It's stupid and pointless."

"It's not pointless. It helps me understand how you're processing the text." I kept my tone neutral, non-judgmental, even though I could see he was on the edge of shutting down completely. "And if there is something making reading more difficult for you, knowing that could help us develop strategies that actually work."

"I don't need strategies. I just need to pass this class."

"You can't pass without reading and understanding the material."

"Then explain it to me." Blake leaned forward, his expression intense. "That's what tutors do, right? You read it, you understand it, you explain it to me so I can write papers that satisfy Dr. Sullivan. That's the whole point of this."

"No," I said. "The point is to teach you how to read critically and analyze literature yourself. I'm not here to do your work for you."

"I'm not asking you to do my work. I'm asking you to teach me efficiently instead of making me read aloud like I'm six."

"Blake—"

"Just explain the chapter." His voice was tight. "Tell me what Jordan says about Gatsby and Daisy, what it means for the rest of the novel, how to use it in my paper. That's what I need."

I looked at him—really looked at him. Saw past the defensiveness and the anger to the humiliation underneath. He'd stumbled through that reading, and it had cost him something. Pride, maybe. Or the carefully constructed facade that he was fine, that he was just lazy, that charm could fix everything.

And now he was asking me to let him off the hook. To give him answers instead of teaching him how to find them himself. To let him keep hiding whatever he was actually struggling with.

I could do it. It would be easier. Less confrontation, less tension. He'd probably be grateful, might even stop treating me like dirt.

But it wouldn't help him. And despite everything—despite his contempt and his "charity case" comment and his entitled attitude—I couldn't do that. Couldn't take money for pretending to teach while actually enabling him to keep failing.

"No," I said quietly. "I won't just give you answers. That's not teaching—that's academic dishonesty, and we'd both be in trouble if anyone found out. You need to learn how to engage with these texts yourself."

Blake stood up abruptly. "Then this is pointless. You want me to admit I'm stupid, is that it? Want me to beg for help?"

"I don't think you're stupid," I said, and I meant it. "I think you're struggling with something you won't admit to, and that's making everything harder."

"You don't know anything about me."

"I know you showed up without having done the reading. I know you can't summarize what happens in the chapters we're studying. I know you read aloud like every word is painful." I stood too, matching his intensity. "And I know that's not laziness. Lazy people don't look humiliated when they struggle. They just don't care."

Blake's hands clenched. "I care about passing."

"Then let me help you actually pass. Not by giving you shortcuts, but by figuring out what's actually in your way."

For a moment, I thought he might walk out. His body was angled toward the door, his expression torn between anger and something that looked like desperation.

Then his shoulders sagged slightly. "What do you want from me?"

"Come to Wednesday's session having read chapter five. Actually read it—don't skim, don't just look for plot points. Read it carefully and write down three things you notice. Anything—a phrase that seems important, a symbol, a question about character motivation. Just three observations."

"That's it?"

"That's it. Three observations about chapter five. And show up on time."

Blake picked up his bag. "And if I do this, will you stop making me read aloud?"

"We'll see."

He looked at me like he was trying to figure out whether I was his enemy or ally.

"Fine. Three observations. Chapter five. Wednesday at seven."

"On time," I emphasized.

"On time," he agreed, and there might have been the tiniest hint of respect in his voice.

He left, and I collapsed into my chair, exhausted.

The session hadn't been a complete disaster, but it hadn't been a success either. Blake was still defensive, still hiding his real problem. But he'd agreed to do the work. That was something.

I gathered my materials slowly. The library was still busy, students surrounded by textbooks and coffee, the quiet hum of focused work.

I wondered if Blake would actually do the reading. If he'd show up Wednesday with observations, or blow it off.

I wondered why I cared so much.

But I did care. Despite everything, I wanted to help him.

I just wasn't sure he wanted to be helped.
