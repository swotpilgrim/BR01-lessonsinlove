# Chapter 12: Warning Signs

Winter break was both wonderful and terrible.

Wonderful because Blake texted me constantly—pictures from business dinners with captions like "Save me from discussing quarterly earnings," late-night messages when he couldn't sleep, video calls where we talked about nothing and everything.

Terrible because the distance made me realize how much I'd come to depend on his presence. How much I missed him. How deeply I'd fallen despite all my attempts at caution.

Emma returned to campus two days before I did. When I finally made it back to our dorm room after my bus ride from Burlington, she took one look at me and hugged me tight.

"You missed him," she said.

"So much it's embarrassing."

"That's not embarrassing. That's being in love."

I pulled back, staring at her. "I'm not—"

"Rachel. You spent break texting him every spare minute, smiling at your phone like an idiot, talking about him constantly. You're in love with him."

Was I? The word felt huge and terrifying. But also... accurate.

"Oh god," I said. "I'm in love with Blake Ashford."

"Yeah, you are." Emma squeezed my shoulders. "The question is, does he love you back?"

I didn't have an answer.

Blake returned to campus the next day. I was working my shift at the campus bookstore when he walked in, and the smile that lit up his face when he saw me answered Emma's question pretty clearly.

He crossed the store in quick strides and pulled me into a hug that lifted me off my feet.

"I missed you," he said into my hair.

"I missed you too."

"Can you take a break?"

I glanced at Mr. Chen, who was watching with fond amusement. "Go," he said. "Fifteen minutes."

Blake grabbed my hand and pulled me outside into the January cold. Then he kissed me like we'd been apart for months instead of weeks.

"I have something to tell you," he said when we finally broke apart. "My father wants to meet you."

My stomach dropped. "What?"

"He knows about us. Kit's parents mentioned it to him—apparently the Ashford Academy parent network is very efficient at spreading gossip." Blake's jaw was tight. "He's coming to campus next weekend. He wants to take us both to dinner."

"Blake, that's—I don't think that's a good idea."

"I know. But if I say no, he'll make it worse. At least this way I can control the situation, be there to..." Blake trailed off.

"To what? Protect me from your father?"

"If necessary, yes."

I pulled my hand from his. "Blake, if your father disapproves of me—of us—what happens?"

"Nothing. He doesn't get a say in who I date."

"He pays for your school. Your life. Everything."

"And I'll figure out alternatives if he makes it an issue." Blake reached for me again. "Rachel, I'm not going to let my father end this. What we have—it matters more than his approval."

I wanted to believe him. But I'd seen how Blake's father's disapproval affected him, how desperately Blake wanted to prove himself worthy of the Ashford name.

"Okay," I said finally. "Dinner with your father. Next weekend."

"You don't have to—"

"If this is happening, I'd rather face it than wonder." I forced a smile. "Besides, how bad can one dinner be?"

Blake's expression suggested it could be very bad indeed.

---

The week leading up to the dinner was tense. Blake was distracted, stressed in ways I hadn't seen since those first tutoring sessions. He snapped at Kit during crew practice, struggled to focus during our study sessions, texted his father multiple times trying to change the dinner plans.

His father refused to budge.

Emma helped me pick an outfit—the green dress from our first date, paired with a cardigan to make it more conservative. "You look perfect," she said. "Respectable but not trying too hard."

"I feel like I'm going to throw up."

"That's normal when meeting the disapproving rich father of the boy you're in love with."

Blake picked me up looking equally nervous in khakis and a button-down. "You look beautiful," he said.

"You look terrified."

"I am terrified." He helped me into his car. "But we'll get through this."

The restaurant was in Burlington—expensive, stuffy, the kind of place where the prices weren't listed on the menu. Blake's father was already there, seated at a table near the back.

William Ashford looked exactly like I'd imagined—tall, distinguished, expensive suit, the kind of presence that commanded attention. He stood when we approached, his eyes sweeping over me with cool assessment.

"Father," Blake said, his voice carefully neutral. "This is Rachel Winters. Rachel, my father, William Ashford."

"Mr. Ashford." I extended my hand, keeping my voice steady. "It's nice to meet you."

His handshake was firm, brief. "Ms. Winters. Please, sit."

The dinner was excruciating. William Ashford asked pointed questions disguised as polite conversation. Where was I from? What did my mother do? What were my plans after graduation?

Each question felt like a test I was failing.

"Scholarship student," he said when I mentioned my financial aid. "That must be difficult. Always being aware of the gap between yourself and your peers."

"It has its challenges," I said carefully. "But it also taught me not to take opportunities for granted."

"Mmm." His eyes flicked to Blake. "And you two met through tutoring? Blake's English grades have improved significantly this semester."

"Rachel's an excellent teacher," Blake said, his hand finding mine under the table.

"I'm sure she is. Though I must wonder—Ms. Winters, what are your intentions regarding my son?"

I blinked. "My intentions?"

"Blake comes from a prominent family with certain expectations and responsibilities. His future involves business school, eventually taking a leadership role in Ashford industries. That future has been planned since he was born." William Ashford's voice was pleasant but his eyes were ice. "I'm curious whether you see yourself fitting into that future, or if this is simply a... college romance."

"Father," Blake said, his voice tight with anger. "That's completely inappropriate—"

"I'm asking a reasonable question about a relationship that affects my son's future."

"My relationship with Rachel is none of your business."

"Everything about you is my business. I'm your father."

"Being my father doesn't give you the right to interrogate Rachel like she's on trial."

William Ashford's expression hardened. "Blake, perhaps Ms. Winters and I should speak privately."

"Absolutely not."

"It's okay," I heard myself say. Blake turned to me, looking horrified, but I squeezed his hand. "If your father has concerns, let's address them."

Blake looked like he wanted to argue, but I held his gaze until he reluctantly nodded and excused himself to the restroom.

The moment Blake was gone, William Ashford's pleasant facade dropped completely.

"Let me be direct, Ms. Winters. You seem like a bright young woman. Hardworking, ambitious. But you're not appropriate for Blake."

"Because I'm a scholarship student."

"Because you come from different worlds. Blake's path is set—business school, executive training, eventually running Ashford industries. That life involves social obligations, networking, maintaining relationships with families like ours. Could you handle that? Honestly?"

I thought about fancy networking events, business dinners, a life lived in expensive restaurants and exclusive clubs. A life where I'd always be the scholarship girl who didn't quite belong.

"I don't know," I admitted.

"At least you're honest." He leaned forward. "I'm not a villain, Ms. Winters. I want my son to be happy. But I also want him to succeed in the life he was born to. Dating you—it's a distraction from his responsibilities. A detour from his actual future."

"Blake should get to choose his future."

"Blake is eighteen. He thinks with his heart instead of his head. That's why he has parents to guide him." William Ashford pulled out his wallet, extracting a check already made out. To me. For ten thousand dollars.

I stared at it, not touching it.

"For your trouble," he said. "Break up with Blake. Cleanly, quietly. Tell him you've realized you want different things. He'll be hurt, but he'll move on. And you'll have enough money to ease your financial pressures considerably."

Ten thousand dollars. That was more money than I'd see in two years of working campus jobs. That was spring semester textbooks and helping my mom and not worrying about every penny.

That was also a price tag on my relationship. On my integrity.

I looked at William Ashford and understood why Blake struggled so hard under the weight of his expectations. This man saw everything—including his son's happiness—as a transaction.

"No," I said quietly.

"Excuse me?"

"No. I won't take your money. And I won't break up with Blake because you think I'm not good enough for your family's dynasty."

"Ms. Winters—"

"Blake is one of the kindest, most thoughtful people I've ever met. He works hard, he's brilliant when he's given the chance to shine, and he deserves better than a father who tries to buy off anyone who doesn't fit into predetermined boxes."

William Ashford's expression turned glacial. "You're making a mistake."

"Maybe. But it's my mistake to make."

Blake returned then, looking between us with worried eyes. "Everything okay?"

"Fine," his father said, his pleasant mask back in place. "Ms. Winters and I were just getting to know each other."

The rest of the dinner was tense and brief. William Ashford made polite conversation while his eyes promised consequences. I picked at my expensive meal and tried not to shake.

When we finally escaped to Blake's car, he turned to me immediately.

"What did he say to you?"

"He offered me money to break up with you."

Blake's hands tightened on the steering wheel. "He what?"

"Ten thousand dollars. To end things cleanly."

"That bastard. Rachel, I'm so sorry—"

"I said no."

Blake looked at me, his eyes searching my face. "You said no?"

"Of course I said no. I'm not breaking up with you because your father doesn't approve."

"Even though ten thousand dollars would help you so much?"

"Even though." I reached for his hand. "Blake, if we're going to make this work, we have to actually choose each other. Not just when it's easy."

He pulled me into a fierce hug. "I choose you. Always."

"I choose you too."

But as Blake drove back to campus, I couldn't shake the feeling that William Ashford's warning was actually a threat.

And that choosing each other was about to get a lot harder.
