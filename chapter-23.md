# Chapter 23: Decision Point

Blake stood outside Dr. Sullivan's office Wednesday afternoon, two days before winter formal.

He'd been thinking about this conversation for weeks. Ever since his father had threatened Rachel's scholarship. Ever since Blake had watched Rachel walk away, choosing her future over him—the right choice, but it still felt like dying.

He knocked.

"Come in."

Dr. Sullivan looked up from her desk, surprise crossing her face when she saw him. "Blake. I wasn't expecting you. Please, sit."

He sat, hands clenched on his knees. "I need to tell you something. About my tutoring arrangement. About Rachel."

Dr. Sullivan set down her pen, giving him her full attention. "I'm listening."

It all came out—meeting Rachel through tutoring, how she helped him understand literature, developing unexpected feelings. His father seeing them together, the threats through Michael Porter. Rachel's scholarship held hostage to force them apart.

"My father implied that if Rachel continued 'overstepping boundaries,' the Ashford Foundation would reconsider scholarship funding," Blake finished. "He used institutional power to control my personal life by threatening her education."

Dr. Sullivan's expression had grown progressively darker as he spoke. "That's unethical manipulation.Using donor influence to leverage a student's financial aid."

"But it worked." Blake's frustration leaked through. "Rachel won't even talk to me now. She's terrified of losing her scholarship. And I don't blame her—she should be terrified. My father has that power and he's willing to use it."

"And your grades have suffered because...?"

"Because I can't focus. Because everything reminds me of her. Because my new tutor doesn't actually care if I learn anything." Blake ran a hand through his hair. "But mostly because I'm furious and heartbroken and I don't know how to function when the person I care about was forced to walk away to protect herself from my family."

Dr. Sullivan was quiet for a long moment. "What do you want, Blake?"

"I want my father to stop controlling my life. I want Rachel to get her education without it being used as leverage. I want..." He stopped. "I want to be able to make my own choices without everything being about the Ashford name and money and power."

"Those are big wants."

"I know. And I know you can't fix most of them." Blake met her eyes. "But you should know what's happening. That a student is being threatened because of who she cares about. Because my father decided she's not appropriate."

"I appreciate you telling me." Dr. Sullivan leaned forward. "I've been gathering documentation. Michael Porter has kept records of your father's... conversation. Other faculty members have noticed the situation. If it comes to defending Rachel's scholarship, we'll have evidence of inappropriate pressure."

"Will that be enough? Against my father?"

"I don't know," she admitted. "Your family has significant influence here. But some things are more important than donor relations. Like protecting students from manipulation."

Blake wanted to believe her. But he'd grown up watching his father wield power. He knew how these things worked.

"There's more," he said. "The winter formal. My father expects me to attend with Natalie Brennan. He's made it clear that's the appropriate choice."

"And what do you want?"

"I want to go with Rachel." The words came out fierce. "I want to walk into that formal with her on my arm and show everyone—show my father—that he doesn't get to decide who I care about based on their bank account."

"That would certainly make a statement."

"But it would also put Rachel at risk. Again. My father would retaliate." Blake slumped in his chair. "So I'm going with Natalie, like a good Ashford son, and Rachel will be working cleanup crew, and everyone gets what they want except the two people who actually matter."

Dr. Sullivan was quiet, studying him. "You know, Blake, I've taught at this school for twenty years. I've seen a lot of students from powerful families coast through on their name and money. But I've also seen a few who choose to be more than their family legacy. Who decide what kind of person they want to be, regardless of expectations."

"You're saying I should fight him."

"I'm saying you get to decide what matters to you. Your father's approval, or your own integrity. Conforming to expectations, or standing up for what's right." She smiled slightly. "There's no easy answer. But there is a choice."

Blake sat with that for a moment. A choice. Not just following the path laid out for him, but actively choosing.

"If I ask Rachel to the formal," he said slowly, "my father will follow through on his threats."

"Probably."

"Rachel could lose her scholarship."

"Possibly."

"But if I don't—if I just accept this—then my father wins. He gets to control my life forever by threatening people I care about."

"That's the calculation," Dr. Sullivan agreed. "Though I should point out—Rachel would need to agree to go with you. She may choose differently, given the risks."

"She will choose differently. She'll say no to protect herself." Blake knew Rachel. Knew her fierce determination to finish her education, her terror of losing what she'd worked so hard for. "She'll tell me to go with Natalie and keep my father happy."

"Then perhaps the question is whether you respect her choice, or whether you fight for something different."

Blake thought about Rachel in the library study room, explaining literature like it was the most important thing in the world. Rachel laughing at his terrible impression of his aunt. Rachel crying in the cold when she told him she had to walk away.

Rachel was strong and brilliant and brave. But she was also trapped by circumstances beyond her control, forced to choose survival over happiness because the system was rigged against her.

And Blake had spent his whole life benefiting from that system without questioning it.

"My father told me to go to the formal with someone appropriate," Blake said. "Someone from the right family, the right background. Someone who fits."

"Natalie Brennan."

"Yeah. Except..." Blake looked at Dr. Sullivan directly. "The most appropriate person for me to be with is Rachel. Not because of her family or background, but because she challenges me and teaches me and makes me want to be better than I am. Because she sees past the Ashford name to who I actually am. Because I'm falling in love with her, and that's the most appropriate thing I've ever felt."

Dr. Sullivan smiled. "Then perhaps you have your answer."

"Even if it means fighting my father? Even if it puts Rachel at risk?"

"That's not for me to decide." Dr. Sullivan's expression turned serious. "But I will tell you this—I've seen your father's type before. Men who use power to control others. And the only way they stop is when people refuse to be controlled. When the cost of maintaining that control becomes too high."

Blake stood. "Thank you. For listening. For documenting things. For... being on our side."

"I'm on the side of doing what's right. Sometimes that happens to align with what my students need." She stood as well. "Whatever you decide, Blake, make sure it's your decision. Not your father's, not your family's expectations. Yours."

He left her office with his mind racing. Two days until winter formal. Two days to decide if he was going to keep playing by his father's rules, or if he was finally going to stand up for what—for who—actually mattered.

That evening, Blake sat in his room in the legacy wing while Kit studied at his desk.

"You're thinking loud," Kit said without looking up. "I can practically hear the gears grinding."

"I'm thinking about asking Rachel to winter formal."

Kit's head snapped up. "What? I thought... your father..."

"My father threatened her scholarship to control me. And it worked—she walked away to protect herself. Which was smart and right and I don't blame her." Blake stared at the ceiling. "But I'm realizing that if I keep letting him do this, he'll control my entire life. He'll decide who I date, who I marry, what career I have, everything. Because he can. Because he has the power and I've never challenged it."

"Dude, challenging him means Rachel loses her scholarship."

"Maybe. Or maybe there's a way to fight back that we haven't tried yet." Blake sat up. "Dr. Sullivan is documenting everything. Other faculty know what happened. If my father actually follows through on revoking Rachel's scholarship, there will be evidence that it was retaliation, not legitimate academic cause."

"You think the school will side against your father?"

"I think some things matter more than donor money. Or at least, they should." Blake met Kit's eyes. "I can't keep living like this. Miserable and controlled and watching Rachel suffer because my father decided she's not good enough. Something has to change."

Kit was quiet for a moment. "You know what? My father sits on the board too. And I don't think he'd be okay with using scholarships as leverage to control students' personal lives. That's... that's really messed up, now that I think about it."

"Would he say something?"

"I could ask him." Kit looked thoughtful. "I mean, our families have known each other forever. But this crosses a line. Using institutional power against a student to control your son? That's not just William being William. That's actual abuse of authority."

Hope sparked in Blake's chest. "If other board members questioned it..."

"It might matter. No guarantees, but it might." Kit set down his textbook. "You're really going to do this? Ask Rachel to formal?"

"I'm going to try. She'll probably say no—she's too smart to risk her scholarship on a grand gesture." Blake stood, pacing his small room. "But I need her to know I'm willing to fight for this. For her. That I'm not just accepting my father's control."

"When?"

"Tomorrow. I'll ask her tomorrow."

Blake lay awake that night, staring at the ceiling, thinking about Rachel. About courage and choice and what it meant to finally stand up for something that mattered.

His father had always taught him that power was about control. About maintaining the right associations, the right image, the right status.

But Rachel had taught him something different. That real power was in choosing what you stood for, even when the cost was high. In fighting for what mattered, even when you might lose.

Tomorrow, he'd ask her to winter formal. Not because he thought she'd say yes—she probably wouldn't, shouldn't, couldn't risk it.

But because she deserved to know someone was willing to fight for her.

And because he was done letting his father decide who he got to care about.
