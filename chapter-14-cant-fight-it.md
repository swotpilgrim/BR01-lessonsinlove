# Chapter 14: Can't Fight It

For three days, Blake avoided me.

He skipped our scheduled tutoring sessions—both Monday and Wednesday came and went with empty calendar notifications and no explanations. My texts went unanswered, left on read but never responded to. In Dr. Sullivan's classroom, he sat on the opposite side of the room instead of saving me a seat, his eyes fixed on his desk whenever I looked his way.

I told myself I understood. That he needed space to think, to figure out what he wanted. That the pressure from his family was crushing and he needed time to process. But understanding didn't make it hurt less.

Each morning I woke up hoping for a message. Each evening I went to bed disappointed. I kept replaying that moment in his car—*I love you. Remember that, okay? Whatever happens next, I love you*—and wondering if it had been goodbye.

Emma watched me check my phone obsessively during meals, between classes, every five minutes like a text would magically appear. Finally, on day three, she took it away.

"He's being a coward," she said, not unkindly.

"He's being pressured by his entire family."

"And instead of talking to you about it, he's ghosting you. That's cowardly."

Maybe. But it was also self-preservation. He was protecting himself from having to make an impossible choice. I understood that too, even as it broke something inside me.

On the fourth day, Dr. Sullivan assigned us to discuss *Pride and Prejudice* in pairs. When she paired me with Blake—deliberately, I suspected—neither of us could avoid it anymore.

We met in the library, sitting across from each other at a study table with our books between us like a barrier.

"Hi," Blake said finally.

"Hi."

"I'm sorry. For avoiding you. That was shitty."

"Yeah, it was."

Blake flinched but didn't argue. "I've been trying to figure out what to do. My father's serious about cutting me off. My mother's devastated. Kit's parents have opinions. Everyone has opinions except the one that actually matters."

"Which is?"

"Mine. What I actually want." Blake met my eyes. "But every time I try to figure out what I want versus what I should want, I get confused."

"Do you want to be with me?"

"Yes. God, yes. Every second I've been avoiding you has been torture."

"Then what's the problem?"

"The problem is I love you, but I don't know if loving you is enough. If I can actually choose you over everything else. Over my family, my future, all of it." Blake's voice broke. "I don't know if I'm strong enough to be who you need me to be."

I reached across the table, taking his hand. "I don't need you to be strong. I need you to be honest."

"Honestly? I'm terrified. Of losing my family. Of disappointing everyone. Of choosing you and then resenting you for it later when things get hard."

The admission hurt, but at least it was real.

"Blake, if you're going to resent me, then your father's right. We should end this."

"I don't want to end this!"

"But you don't want to fight for it either!"

Several students looked over at my raised voice. I lowered it. "You're waiting for there to be an easy answer. For your father to magically approve or for me to magically fit into your world. But that's not going to happen. So you have to decide—are we worth the hard choice, or aren't we?"

Blake was quiet for a long moment. Then he stood, pulling me up with him.

"Come with me."

He led me through the library to the third-floor study rooms—to 3C, where we'd had our first tutoring session. Where this had all started. Blake shut the door and turned to face me.

"I've been reading *Pride and Prejudice*. Actually reading it, not just skimming." He pulled out his copy, pages covered in sticky notes and annotations. The sight of his careful color-coding—the system I'd taught him—made my throat tight. "And there's this part near the end where Darcy tells Elizabeth that she's taught him to be better. That loving her made him want to deserve her."

"Blake—"

"Let me finish. Please." He took a breath, and I saw his hands trembling slightly. "You've taught me so much this semester. Not just about literature, but about myself. About working hard instead of coasting. About believing I can succeed at things that don't come easily. About choosing what I actually value instead of just accepting what my father values for me."

He took both my hands in his, and I felt the warmth of his touch after three days of cold absence.

"I value you, Rachel. I value us. And I'm sorry I let fear make me pull away instead of pulling you closer."

My eyes stung. I'd spent three days convincing myself I'd lost him, that his father had won, that love wasn't enough. And here he was, looking at me like I was the most important thing in his world.

"So what are you saying?"

"I'm saying I choose you. I choose us. Even if it means my father cuts me off. Even if it means figuring out student loans and part-time jobs and all the things I don't know how to do yet. Even if it's hard." Blake cupped my face with both hands. "Because losing you would be harder. Living without you would be harder."

"Your father won't change his mind."

"I know. But maybe I don't need him to. Maybe I just need to accept that his approval isn't worth having if it means losing you."

"Blake, are you sure? Really sure? Because if you choose me now and change your mind later—"

He kissed me before I could finish. Kissed me like I was air and he'd been drowning. When we finally broke apart, we were both breathing hard.

"I'm sure," he said. "I love you. I'm in love with you. And I want to fight for this. For us. Will you let me?"

I wanted to. God, I wanted to so badly. But I'd spent three days watching him pull away, wondering if I'd lost him, feeling the weight of being the cause of his family drama.

"What if it's too hard? What if choosing me ruins your relationship with your family forever?"

"Then it does. They're the ones making that choice, not me. I'm just choosing to love someone they don't approve of. That's on them."

"You say that now—"

"Rachel." Blake pressed his forehead to mine. "I know this is scary. I know you've been hurt. But please, please give us another chance. Let me prove I can choose you every day. Not just once, but continuously."

I thought about walking away. About protecting myself from the inevitable heartbreak. About going back to my peaceful life before Blake Ashford complicated everything.

But I also thought about tutoring sessions that became real conversations. About Blake bringing me coffee and learning my favorite order. About the way he looked at me like I was precious. About falling asleep texting him and waking up to good morning messages. About loving him so much it terrified me.

I couldn't walk away. Not from this. Not from him.

"Okay," I whispered.

"Okay?"

"Okay. Another chance. But Blake, if you pull away again—if you let fear drive you instead of talking to me—I can't do this. I need you to actually be in this with me."

"I will be. I promise. No more avoiding, no more ghosting. If I'm scared, I tell you. If my father escalates, I tell you. We face it together."

"Together."

"Together."

He kissed me again, and this time it felt different. Like a promise instead of goodbye. Like a beginning instead of an end.

We stayed in study room 3C for hours after that, talking through everything. Not just declarations and promises, but actual practical plans.

"If my father cuts me off, I'll apply for financial aid," Blake said. "I should qualify for student loans like everyone else. And I can get a campus job. You've been working multiple jobs since freshman year—you can teach me how to manage it."

"It's not easy, Blake. The hours, the exhaustion, trying to balance everything."

"I know. But you do it. If you can do it, I can learn." He squeezed my hand. "And we'll have each other. That's more than I've had before."

We talked about how to handle his family's reaction, the social pressure from both sides, what it would mean to be visibly together on campus. Blake was clear—no more hiding, no more pretending this was just tutoring. He wanted to be with me openly, whatever the consequences.

"My father will escalate," Blake said quietly. "He doesn't lose gracefully. He'll try to make things difficult for both of us."

"I know."

"And you're still willing to do this?"

"Are you?"

"Yes," he said without hesitation. "Absolutely yes."

It felt real. Solid. Like we were actually in this together instead of just drifting and hoping things would magically work out.

When we finally left the library, it was dark outside. Blake walked me to my dorm, holding my hand the entire way despite students watching and whispering.

At my door, he pulled me close.

"Thank you for not giving up on me. Even when I was giving up on myself."

"Thank you for choosing us."

"Always. From now on, always us."

I believed him. Maybe that was naive, maybe we were setting ourselves up for more pain. But standing there with Blake holding me like I was something worth fighting for—I believed him.

And I believed in us.

Whatever came next, we'd face it together.
