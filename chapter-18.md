# Chapter 18: Almost

The library was almost empty Friday night before Thanksgiving break. Most students had left campus, eager to get home. The third floor felt abandoned, just the whisper of heat through old radiators.

Perfect.

Blake arrived at seven with his laptop and the anthology I'd assigned. Snow had started falling, already coating the campus. Through the windows, I could see it coming down harder—fat flakes catching the streetlamp light.

"They're saying six inches tonight," Blake said, shrugging out of his coat. Snowflakes clung to his hair. "Half the campus is panicking about travel delays."

"Are you worried? About getting to Connecticut?"

"My father sent the car. The driver will get us there." He sat close enough that our knees almost touched. "What about you? Are you sure you don't want to—"

"I'm fine here," I cut him off gently. We'd had this conversation twice already. The idea of meeting his family made my stomach tight.

"Right." He opened his laptop, then closed it. "So. Romantic poetry."

"Your essay is supposed to analyze how the Romantics used nature imagery to express emotional truth."

"That's a fancy way of saying they wrote about feelings and trees."

I laughed. "Not one that will get you an A, but sure."

Blake grinned. This had become familiar—the easy banter, making each other laugh. So different from those early hostile tutoring sessions.

"Okay, seriously," he said. "I read the poems. Keats, Wordsworth, Byron. I actually... kind of liked them?"

"You sound surprised."

"I am. Poetry usually makes me feel stupid. But these are about real things. Not just fancy language."

"Exactly." I leaned forward. "The Romantics believed emotion was as important as reason. They wrote about passion. Love, loss, longing. The things that make us human." I gestured to his book. "Pick one. Read it aloud."

Blake looked uncertain. "I'm not good at reading aloud."

"You're better than you think. Come on. Just try."

He was quiet for a moment, then found another page. "Okay. This one. Keats."

"'Bright Star,'" I said, recognizing it. My heart stuttered slightly. Of all the poems in the anthology, he'd picked one of the most romantic.

Blake cleared his throat, then began reading. His voice was quiet, almost hesitant at first:

"'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite...'"

He stumbled slightly over "Eremite" but kept going. As he read, something shifted in the air between us. The words—Keats's longing to remain unchanging, to rest forever in a moment of perfect connection—hung in the small study room like a confession.

"'...Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.'"

The silence after he finished felt enormous. Blake's eyes lifted from the page to meet mine, and I couldn't look away. The poem was about wanting to freeze time, to hold onto a perfect moment forever. About loving someone so much that eternal separation would be death.

"That's..." Blake's voice came out rough. He cleared his throat. "That's pretty intense."

"Keats was dying when he wrote it," I said. My own voice wasn't entirely steady. "He knew he didn't have much time. He wanted to hold onto what mattered."

"What mattered to him was love."

"Yes."

We were still looking at each other. The study room felt smaller suddenly, the air charged with something I couldn't name. Outside, snow fell in the darkness. The library was empty except for us. No one would interrupt. No one would see.

"Rachel," Blake said quietly.

"Yeah?"

"Can I ask you something?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"When we're like this—" He gestured between us. "When it's just us, and we're talking, and everything feels easy... do you feel it too?"

"Feel what?"

He held my gaze. "Like this is the most real thing in my life. Like everything else is just performance, but this—us—is actually true."

My breath caught. "Yes. I feel it too."

Blake's hand moved across the table, covering mine. His thumb traced the same circles on my palm that had become familiar. "I know we said we'd be careful. That we'd take this slow. But I need you to know..." He paused, seeming to gather courage. "I'm falling for you. Maybe I already have."

The words hung between us, vulnerable and honest. I should pull back. Should remind him of all the reasons this was complicated—our different worlds, his father's disapproval, my scholarship. But looking at Blake, seeing the fear and hope in his eyes, I couldn't make myself lie.

"I'm falling for you too," I whispered.

Something shifted in Blake's expression—relief and joy and desire all at once. He leaned forward slightly. I mirrored the movement without thinking. His free hand came up to cup my cheek, warm against my skin.

"Can I kiss you?" he asked, his voice barely audible.

I nodded. My heart was pounding so hard I was certain he could hear it. This was crossing a line we'd been carefully avoiding. Once we kissed, there was no pretending this was just friendship or tutoring. This would be real and undeniable.

But God, I wanted it.

Blake leaned closer. I closed my eyes, feeling his breath warm on my face. His lips were almost touching mine—

The study room door banged open.

We sprang apart like we'd been electrocuted. Blake knocked over his water bottle, sending it rolling across the table. I grabbed for papers that hadn't actually moved, my face burning.

Two juniors I vaguely recognized stood in the doorway, looking for a study room. They glanced at us curiously, noting our guilty expressions and the sudden distance between us.

"Sorry," the girl said. "Didn't know anyone was using this room."

"It's fine," Blake said, his voice strained. "We were just—working on an essay."

They nodded and moved on to check the next room. The door closed behind them with a soft click. Blake and I sat in thick silence, both trying to process what had almost happened.

"That was..." I started.

"Close," Blake finished. He ran a hand through his hair, leaving it disheveled. "Really close."

"Maybe it's a sign." My voice shook slightly. "That we shouldn't—that this is too complicated—"

"Or maybe it's just bad timing." Blake looked at me intently. "Rachel, I meant what I said. About falling for you. That didn't change in the last thirty seconds."

"I know. But..." I gestured helplessly. "This is real now. Once we cross that line, there's no going back. And there are consequences we haven't thought through."

"I think about consequences constantly." His frustration was evident. "My father, your scholarship, what people will say. But I'm tired of living my life based on what might happen. I want to make choices based on what I actually want."

"And what do you want?"

"You." The simple honesty in his voice made my chest ache. "I want you, Rachel. Not carefully. Not halfway. Just... you."

I looked at him—really looked. Blake Ashford III, who'd been a name and an assumption before he became this person. This complicated, thoughtful, kind person who read romantic poetry in an empty library and looked at me like I mattered.

"I want you too," I said. "But I'm terrified."

"Me too." He smiled slightly. "Can being terrified together count as bravery?"

Despite everything, I laughed. "Maybe."

Blake checked his watch, then looked out at the falling snow. "I should probably let you get back. And I have to finish packing."

Neither of us moved. The moment felt fragile, like if we left this room the magic would break and reality would come crashing back.

"Four days," I said. "That's how long Thanksgiving break is."

"Four days," Blake agreed. "Then I come back and we figure this out."

"Figure what out?"

"How to do this. How to be together despite everything that says we shouldn't be." He stood, gathering his things slowly. "If you still want to. After you have time to think about it."

I stood too. "Blake—"

"It's okay." He cut me off gently. "I'm not trying to pressure you. I just needed you to know where I stand. The rest is up to you."

We packed up our belongings in charged silence, hyperaware of each other in the small space. When we left the study room, the library was completely empty now. Our footsteps echoed on the old wooden floors as we descended to the first floor.

Outside, the snow had intensified. The campus looked like a Christmas card—white drifts on brick buildings, lights glowing warm in windows, everything clean and perfect. We walked slowly toward my dorm, neither of us speaking. Words felt inadequate anyway.

At the entrance to my building, Blake stopped. "So. Four days."

"Four days."

He reached for my hand, fingers lacing through mine, solid and warm. We stood in the falling snow, holding hands.

"Happy Thanksgiving, Rachel."

"Happy Thanksgiving."

Blake squeezed my hand once, then let go. He backed away, still looking at me like he was memorizing the moment. Then he turned and walked toward the legacy wing, getting smaller in the swirling snow.

I watched until he disappeared around the corner. Then I went inside, climbing the stairs to my room.

Emma was already asleep. I got ready for bed quietly, my mind replaying everything. Blake's voice reading Keats. The almost-kiss. His confession. My own.

I touched my lips, thinking about how close we'd come. Part of me was grateful for the reprieve—once we kissed, everything would change. But another part ached with the loss of that almost-moment.

Four days. I had four days to think about what I wanted, what I was willing to risk.

Outside, snow continued to fall on Ashford. The campus was quiet, most students gone. But the silence felt full of possibility, like the world was holding its breath.

I fell asleep thinking about bright stars and eternal moments. About Blake's eyes as he'd almost kissed me, full of hope and fear and certainty.

We'd been so close.

And in four days, we'd get another chance. The question was whether I'd be brave enough to take it.
