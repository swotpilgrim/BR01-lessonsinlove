# Chapter 1: The Scholarship Girl

The October morning air bit at my cheeks as I cut across Ashford Academy's main quad, my worn canvas bookbag heavy against my shoulder. Around me, students drifted toward their first classes in expensive wool coats and designer scarves, their breath forming clouds in the crisp Vermont air. I pulled my secondhand peacoat—purchased from the Salvation Army in Burlington last spring—tighter around myself and kept walking.

"I'm telling you, the Hamptons house is so much better in October," a girl near the library steps said to her friend. Both wore matching Burberry scarves. "Daddy says we can use it for Columbus Day weekend next year."

I didn't slow down. Comments like that were as common as the ivy covering Ashford Hall's brick facade. After two months of senior year, I'd learned to let them slide past without sticking. Most of the time.

The campus looked like something out of a brochure—brick buildings with ivy-covered walls, manicured lawns, the kind of timeless prep school beauty that came with a fifty-thousand-dollar annual tuition. My full scholarship covered tuition and room and board, but not much else. Not the textbooks or the preppy wardrobe or the casual weekend trips everyone else seemed to take without thinking.

The campus bookstore sat in the basement of Morrison Hall. My shift started at seven, giving me an hour before first period. The pay was minimum wage, but Mr. Chen let me study when things were slow.

"Morning, Rachel." Mr. Chen gestured to a stack of boxes. "New shipment needs stocking before we open."

I got to work, arranging notebooks while expensive shoes passed by the high windows above. No one looked down. They never did.

By eight o'clock, I'd clocked out and headed to Heritage Hall for first period English with Dr. Sullivan. I took my usual seat in the second row and pulled out my worn copy of *The Great Gatsby*. Behind me, someone discussed weekend regatta plans and new blazers.

"Good morning, class." Dr. Sullivan swept in exactly at the bell. "I trust you all completed the reading for today—chapters six through nine of Gatsby."

I had. I always did.

"Rachel, would you start us off? What's Fitzgerald doing with the weather in chapter seven?"

I sat up straighter, grateful to have something concrete to focus on. "He's using the heat as a pressure cooker for the tension between characters. Everything feels oppressive and inevitable, like something has to break."

"Excellent observation." Dr. Sullivan's eyes crinkled. "The environment mirrors the emotional stakes. Mr. Ashford, can you build on that?"

Blake Ashford III looked up with an easy smile, the kind that probably got him out of most situations.

"The heat definitely makes everything more intense," he said, his voice smooth and confident. "You can feel the characters getting more desperate."

It wasn't wrong, exactly. It just wasn't specific. It was the kind of answer someone gave when they'd skimmed the SparkNotes instead of doing the actual reading. Dr. Sullivan's mouth tightened almost imperceptibly.

"Can you point to a specific passage that demonstrates this desperation, Mr. Ashford?"

Blake's smile didn't waver. "I think it's throughout the chapter, really. The accumulation of small moments."

Translation: he hadn't done the reading. I'd seen students like Blake my entire time at Ashford—coasting on family names and charm, expecting the world to bend around them. Usually it did.

"I see." Dr. Sullivan's tone suggested she saw right through him. "Moving on..."

The rest of class passed in a familiar rhythm. I contributed when called upon, took careful notes, and tried not to feel the weight of being one of the only scholarship students in a room full of people whose families had buildings named after them. The Ashford family literally founded this school. Blake probably had ancestors staring down from oil paintings in the administrative wing.

When Dr. Sullivan announced the major paper—a five-page analysis of *The Great Gatsby* due before Thanksgiving break—I was already mentally outlining mine. Wealth and class in the American Dream. The emptiness of material success. The green light as symbol of unattainable desires. I had thoughts.

Blake, I noticed, barely wrote down the assignment.

After class, I headed to my library shift. Morrison Library was my favorite place on campus, all dark wood and tall windows and the kind of quiet that felt holy.

Near the reference section, a group of junior girls discussed weekend parties and borrowed Range Rovers. They didn't glance up as I shelved books two feet away. I might as well have been furniture.

By noon, I headed to the dining hall, a cavernous space with assigned house tables and oil paintings of distinguished alumni. Emma Bradford waved from our usual table near the windows, trays already waiting—Caesar salad, wheat rolls, something that might have been chicken.

"How was the library?" Emma asked as I slid into my seat. Her dark hair was pulled back in a neat ponytail, and she'd somehow made a thrifted cardigan look put-together.

"Quiet. Lots of studying for midterms." I bit into my roll. "How was work?"

"Mr. Chen got a shipment of Ashford Academy sweatshirts. Forty-five dollars each." Emma's voice was carefully neutral, but I heard the edge underneath. "A girl bought six. Said she needed backups for crew practice."

Six sweatshirts. Three hundred dollars on backup clothing. My mother worked double shifts as a nurse to make rent on our apartment in Burlington. I bought my textbooks used and rationed my meal points.

"Must be nice," I said.

Emma leaned forward. "Speaking of jobs—did you see the flyer in the academic support office? They're hiring tutors."

I hadn't. "Tutors for what?"

"Whatever subjects students need help in. But here's the thing—it pays really well. Like, fifteen dollars an hour." Emma's eyes were bright with possibility. "That's more than double what we make at the bookstore."

Fifteen dollars an hour. I did the math automatically. Three sessions a week—forty-five dollars. That could cover textbooks for spring semester.

"What's the catch?"

"You have to be recommended by faculty and maintain a certain GPA. But Rachel, you're perfect for it. You've got a 4.0."

She was right. The money would help.

"Where do I apply?"

"Academic support office in Heritage Hall. Michael Porter is the coordinator." Emma squeezed my hand. "You deserve something good."

The thing about being a scholarship student at Ashford was learning not to expect things. Opportunities had to be earned, not given.

But fifteen dollars an hour? That was payment for skills I'd actually earned.

After lunch, I had advanced calculus—where I struggled to keep up despite hours of extra study—and then European history. By three-thirty, I'd made my decision.

The academic support office was tucked in a corner of Heritage Hall's second floor, easy to miss if you didn't know where to look. The door stood open, revealing a small space with motivational posters about growth mindsets and perseverance. A man in his early thirties sat at a desk covered in papers and coffee mugs.

I knocked on the doorframe. "Hi. I'm looking for Michael Porter?"

"You found him." He looked up with a genuine smile, the kind that reached his eyes. "What can I do for you?"

"I heard you're hiring tutors. I wanted to apply."

"Great! Come in, have a seat." He gestured to a chair across from his desk, moving a stack of folders to make room. "What's your name?"

"Rachel Winters. I'm a senior."

He typed something into his computer, then his eyebrows rose. "Wow. 4.0 GPA, honor roll every semester, working two campus jobs. That's impressive."

Heat crept up my neck. Compliments always made me uncomfortable. "I work hard."

"I can see that." He leaned back in his chair, studying me with thoughtful brown eyes. "Can I be honest with you, Rachel?"

Never a good sign. "Sure."

"The tutoring position pays well because it's for students struggling despite having every resource available. Usually legacy students whose families expect perfection but haven't noticed their kids need support. Sometimes those students can be... challenging."

Rich kids with attitudes who'd resent being tutored by a scholarship student. I'd dealt with worse.

"I can handle challenging," I said.

Michael smiled. "I believe you can. When can you start?"

"Whenever you need me."

"How about Thursday evening? I've got a student who needs English literature help. He's bright but avoiding the work—now he's facing academic probation."

Academic probation at Ashford was practically unheard of. Someone's parents were probably furious.

"Thursday works."

"I'll email you the details—time, location, student name. We do three sessions a week in the private study rooms on Morrison Library's third floor."

By the time I left his office, I was calculating my paycheck. Three ninety-minute sessions at fifteen dollars an hour—sixty-seven fifty weekly. With my other jobs, I could send more money home to Mom.

The autumn sun slanted low across campus as I walked back to my dorm. Students sprawled on the quad studying, expensive sunglasses catching the light. Boys in crew team jackets tossed a football, their laughter carrying across the grass.

I didn't belong in their world. But I'd earned my place here, and I'd earned this tutoring job the same way.

For once, something felt like it might go right.

I climbed the stairs to the third floor dormitories. Emma would be in our room, working on calculus homework. I'd tell her the good news.

Neither of us knew yet who my student would be.

Neither of us knew that Thursday evening, when I walked into that library study room, my entire senior year would shift.

But that was still two days away.

For now, I just felt hopeful.
