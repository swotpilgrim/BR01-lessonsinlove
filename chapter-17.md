# Chapter 17: Secret Moments

We became experts at finding quiet spaces.

The third-floor library study rooms on Tuesday afternoons when most students had athletics. The path through the woods behind the science building where bare December trees created a cathedral of branches overhead. The alcove near the chapel with cold stone benches that forced us to keep our visits brief, but gave us privacy to talk without eyes tracking our every word.

It had been a week since I took Blake's hand in the snow, since we crossed the line from tutoring arrangement to something neither of us could quite name yet. We were careful—not hiding exactly, but not broadcasting either. At Ashford, gossip spread faster than Vermont winter, and we both knew what scrutiny would come if people realized this was more than academic.

"Your turn," Blake said.

We were in our usual library study room Thursday evening, supposedly working on his essay about symbolism in *Wuthering Heights*. His laptop was open, showing half a page of actual writing—progress—but we'd spent the last hour talking instead. Talking the way we never could in public spaces, without armor or performance.

"My turn for what?" I asked, though I knew.

"Tell me something real." Blake had his chair turned toward mine instead of the desk, his expression serious. "Not about books or school. About you."

I'd been keeping our conversations in safer territory. But Blake had just told me about the summer he was ten, when his father took him to the family business headquarters and spent six hours explaining the Ashford legacy—the responsibilities, the expectations, the weight of a name that opened doors but also boxed you in. Blake had described feeling like he was suffocating in that office, understanding for the first time that his life was already mapped out and his opinion didn't matter.

"Fair's fair," he said softly. "I told you mine."

I looked at my hands, at the calluses from work shifts and the ink stain on my thumb from a pen that leaked. Real. He wanted real.

"My father left when I was twelve," I said. The words came out flat, factual. "Just packed a bag one day and walked out. No explanation, no goodbye. My mother came home from her nursing shift and found his wedding ring on the kitchen counter."

Blake didn't say anything, just waited. That was one of the things I'd learned about him—he knew how to listen.

"We were already struggling financially. After he left, it got worse." I traced the wood grain on the desk with one finger. "My mother picked up double shifts, sometimes triples. I'd come home from school to an empty apartment, make dinner for one, do homework alone. She'd get home after midnight smelling like hospital antiseptic, so tired she could barely stand."

"Rachel—"

"I watched her work herself into exhaustion," I continued, needing to finish now that I'd started. "Watched her choose between paying rent and buying groceries. Watched her cry when she thought I was asleep. And I swore I'd never be that vulnerable. Never depend on someone who could just walk away and destroy everything."

The silence stretched between us. Outside the window, snow fell in the darkness.

"Is that why you keep expecting me to disappoint you?" Blake asked finally.

I met his eyes. "Maybe. Or maybe I'm just realistic about how different we are."

"We're not that different."

"Blake." I gestured between us. "You have a trust fund. I have student loans waiting for me the second I graduate—if I graduate. Your family has a house in Connecticut. My mother rents a one-bedroom apartment we can barely afford. Those differences are real."

"I know." He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "I'm not trying to minimize that. But the things that matter—the fears, the pressure, feeling trapped—those aren't so different."

"Your trapped and my trapped aren't the same thing."

"No," he agreed. "But they're both real. And they both hurt."

I wanted to argue, to maintain the distinction between his privileged problems and my actual ones. But sitting there in the warm library while snow fell outside, I couldn't quite summon the energy for that fight.

"Tell me about your mother," Blake said. "Not the hard parts. Something good."

The shift surprised me. "What?"

"You said she worked double shifts. What else? What's she like when she's not exhausted?"

I thought about it. "She reads," I said slowly. "Romance novels mostly, the grocery store paperbacks. She'd come home from those brutal shifts and still read a chapter or two before bed. Said she needed to remember that happy endings existed."

Blake smiled. "That's where you got it."

"Got what?"

"Your faith in stories. The way you talk about books like they matter."

"They do matter."

"I know. You taught me that." He was quiet for a moment. "What else?"

"She sings." The memory made me smile despite myself. "Terrible voice, completely tone-deaf, but she'd sing along to the radio while making breakfast on her days off. Old songs from when she was young. She'd dance around the kitchen with a spatula, trying to make me laugh."

"I'd like to meet her someday."

The casual statement hit me harder than it should have. Meeting parents meant something serious, meant future tense, meant Blake thought we'd last long enough for that to make sense.

"Maybe," I said, noncommittal.

"Can I ask you something?" I said after a while.

"Always."

"What would you do? Without your father's expectations. What would you want?"

Blake set down his pen. "No one's ever asked me that."

"I'm asking."

"I'd teach. Literature or history. Help students actually understand things." He looked embarrassed. "That sounds stupid."

"It doesn't. You'd be good at it."

"You think?"

"I know. You could help other students find what you found."

"My father would disown me."

"Would that be so terrible?"

Blake considered it. "A month ago, yes. Now I'm not so sure. What's the point of having everything if you're miserable?"

"Spoken like someone who's never had nothing."

"Fair point." He didn't get defensive. "But I'm learning. You're teaching me that security isn't everything. That courage means choosing the hard right thing." He reached across, fingers brushing my hand. "That some things are worth the risk."

My breath caught. Blake's hand covered mine, warm and solid.

"We should probably study," I said, not moving.

"Probably."

Neither of us moved. The moment stretched, charged. We'd been carefully not crossing lines—no kissing, nothing undeniably romantic. As long as we kept distance, we could pretend this was just tutoring.

But we both knew better.

"Rachel," Blake said quietly. His thumb traced circles on my palm. "I—"

The door opened. We sprang apart. Dr. Sullivan stood in the doorway, expression unreadable.

"Mr. Ashford, Miss Winters. Burning the midnight oil?"

"Working on the *Wuthering Heights* essay," Blake said. "Due Monday."

Dr. Sullivan's gaze moved between us. I felt my face heat.

"I'm glad to see such dedication. Blake, I'm impressed with your progress this semester. Your last essay showed real critical thinking."

"Rachel's been a huge help," Blake said.

"I'm sure she has." Dr. Sullivan looked at me. "Miss Winters, stop by my office hours tomorrow. I'd like to discuss your final paper topic."

Not really a request. "Of course."

"Don't stay too late, you two. Even dedicated students need sleep." She left.

Blake and I sat in silence.

"Do you think she knows?" I asked.

"I think Dr. Sullivan knows everything." Blake ran a hand through his hair. "But she wasn't angry."

"She was careful."

"Same thing, at Ashford." He checked his watch. "It's late. I should walk you back."

We gathered our things, the ease slightly fractured. As we left the library, Blake kept careful distance—no hand-holding where people might see. The cold bit through my coat.

"Can we do this again?" Blake asked. "Talk, I mean. Really talk."

"We have tutoring three times a week."

"You know what I mean."

I did. These conversations were different. This was us learning each other.

"Yes," I said.

We reached my dorm too quickly. He stopped at the entrance.

"Thank you," he said.

"For what?"

"For trusting me with that. Your father, your mom."

"Thank you for listening."

"Always." He backed away. "See you tomorrow?"

"Library, three o'clock."

I watched him disappear, then climbed the stairs to find Emma at her desk.

"Long tutoring session," she said.

"We got distracted talking."

"Uh-huh." She set down her pencil. "Rachel, you know I love you, right?"

"This sounds like a lecture."

"A warning. Secrets don't last at boarding school. Whatever's happening with you and Blake—"

"Nothing's happening."

"Don't lie to yourself. I see how you look when you come back. You're falling for him, if you haven't already." Emma's voice was gentle. "When this comes out—and it will—there will be consequences."

"I know."

"Do you? Blake's family has power. You have a scholarship that can be revoked."

I'd been so caught up in stolen moments that I'd forgotten the reality.

"What am I supposed to do? Not feel anything?"

"I don't know. I just don't want to see you hurt. Or lose everything you've worked for."

I sat on my bed, thinking about Blake's hand on mine, about the way he listened.

"I'll be careful," I promised.

Emma didn't look convinced. Neither was I. Careful had gone out the window the moment I took Blake's hand in the snow.

That night I lay awake, thinking about everything Blake and I had shared. He knew about my father, my mother's struggles, the fear that made me build walls. And I knew about the suffocating expectations, dreams he'd never voiced, the person he wanted to be.

We were falling for each other—carefully, terrified, but undeniably. The question was whether we'd be brave enough to see it through.

Outside, snow continued to fall on Ashford's grounds. Tomorrow Blake and I would find another quiet space, continue learning each other in stolen moments. Every day, I fell a little further—into trust, into hope, into feelings I wasn't ready for but couldn't stop.

Emma was right. This couldn't stay secret forever. But for now, I let myself hold onto it a little longer.
