# Chapter 27: Fighting Back

The next three weeks became a careful dance of evidence gathering and quiet resistance.

Dr. Sullivan compiled comprehensive documentation of my academic record—every paper I'd written with her comments noting my insight and analytical skill, every grade I'd earned across all subjects, letters of recommendation from teachers who'd watched me excel despite financial challenges. The evidence painted a clear picture: I was an exemplary student whose conduct had always been professional and appropriate. There was no academic justification for scholarship revocation.

Michael Porter organized the timeline of William's threats with meticulous detail. His records showed William had approached him weeks before winter formal, before Blake and I had even attended any public event together. The threats predated any alleged violation by weeks, proving this was about control and preemptive intimidation, not response to actual misconduct. The dates alone told the story William didn't want revealed.

Blake, Kit, and several other students who'd witnessed the winter formal confrontation submitted detailed statements describing William's public attempt to force Blake away from me. Even some legacy students who'd initially sided with Natalie admitted the display had been uncomfortable—a powerful parent trying to control his adult son through institutional threats in front of gathered classmates. The public nature of William's overreach had worked against him.

"The evidence is compelling," Gregory Hamilton told me in a meeting Dr. Sullivan arranged in the administration building. "William overreached significantly. He used his donor status to manipulate your financial aid, and he did it publicly enough that we have multiple witnesses and a clear timeline. That makes it very difficult for him to claim this was about academic standards."

"But will the board care?" I asked, unable to keep the anxiety from my voice. "William Ashford brings significant money to this school. Millions of dollars over the years."

"Some board members care more about institutional integrity than individual donations, even large ones." Gregory's expression was firm, his business-honed authority evident. "I'm one of them. And I'm not alone. We have children too, Rachel. We don't want to be part of a system that allows parents to weaponize financial aid to control their kids' personal lives."

Meanwhile, Blake was fighting his own battles.

His father had essentially cut him off—no access to family credit cards, no allowance, threats about college tuition. William was using every lever of control he had to force Blake to submit.

But Blake had started working. He picked up shifts at the campus bookstore alongside me, tutored younger students for pay, did whatever he could to prove he could survive without his father's money.

"You don't have to do this," I told him one evening as we restocked shelves together. "You could apologize to your father, go back to the way things were."

"And lose you? No thanks." Blake shelved a book. "Besides, I'm learning something important—I can actually take care of myself. I always thought I needed my family's money, their connections. But I don't. Not really."

"What about college?"

"Loans, scholarships, work study. Same as everyone else." He smiled. "Turns out there's a whole world beyond Ashford trust funds."

I watched him work—this boy who'd once seemed so untouchable, so perfectly privileged—now stacking books for minimum wage and looking happier than I'd ever seen him in his former life.

"I'm proud of you," I said quietly.

"I'm proud of us." Blake reached for my hand across the poetry section. "We're fighting for what matters instead of just accepting what we're told we're allowed to have."

Dr. Sullivan kept me updated on the board proceedings. Gregory Hamilton had called for a full ethics review of William's actions—not just the scholarship revocation, but the entire pattern of using donor influence to manipulate student affairs.

"Other trustees are uncomfortable," she told me. "William isn't the first donor to try leveraging financial support for personal gain, but he was clumsy about it. Did it too publicly. Made it impossible to ignore."

"What happens at the board meeting?"

"They'll review all the evidence. Hear testimony from myself, Michael, and any students who want to speak. Then they'll vote on whether to reinstate your scholarship and potentially censure William for abuse of authority."

"And if they vote against me?"

Dr. Sullivan's expression was serious. "Then we appeal to state education authorities. Document this as donor manipulation and institutional failure. It would be a longer fight, but we'd keep fighting."

The certainty in her voice made me believe her. Dr. Sullivan had become more than a teacher—she was an ally willing to risk her own position to defend what was right.

Blake's relationship with his father deteriorated completely. William stopped taking his calls, sent terse messages through lawyers about Blake's "continued defiance and poor judgment."

Kit told me his father had tried mediating, suggesting William and Blake find a compromise. William had refused. "He's making an example of Blake," Gregory told Dr. Sullivan in my hearing. "Trying to show he won't tolerate disobedience. It's..." He'd struggled for words. "It's cruel. And it's making other board members question his judgment."

The week before the board meeting, Blake moved out of the legacy wing. Not officially—he was still assigned there—but he started spending more time in the common areas, less time in the expensive dormitory that represented everything his father expected him to be.

"I can't live in that space anymore," he told me one evening as we walked through December cold. "Everything about it is my father's money, my father's influence. The furniture he paid for, the paintings his family donated, even the building itself has an Ashford plaque. I need to be somewhere that feels like mine, not his."

He essentially lived in the library, the bookstore, the common study areas, and anywhere else he could be himself rather than Blake Ashford III, heir to the family fortune and bearer of generational expectations.

And watching him choose freedom over comfort, principles over privilege, identity over inheritance—I fell even more in love with him. This was who Blake really was when stripped of his family's power: determined, kind, willing to sacrifice comfort for what mattered. He was more himself working minimum wage and sleeping on study room couches than he'd ever been in the legacy wing.

Students started talking. The initial whispers about inappropriate conduct faded as people saw Blake working minimum wage jobs, saw me continuing to excel academically, saw Dr. Sullivan and Michael Porter fighting so hard for justice.

"What William Ashford did is messed up," I heard one legacy student say in the dining hall. "Using scholarships as weapons to control his kid? That's not okay."

Even Natalie seemed subdued. She'd been vocal initially about how I'd "gotten what I deserved," but as evidence emerged of William's manipulation, her comments trailed off. Maybe even she could see the injustice.

Emma remained my steady anchor. "Two more days until the board meeting," she said as we studied together. "How are you feeling?"

"Terrified. Hopeful. Angry." I set down my textbook. "All of it at once."

"That makes sense. This is huge—not just for your scholarship, but for whether powerful families can use money to control students' lives."

"No pressure."

"You've already won in some ways," Emma pointed out. "You made Blake see beyond his privilege. You got faculty and some board members to actually examine how donor influence works. Even if..." She stopped.

"Even if I lose the vote?"

"Even then, you changed things. Made people pay attention."

I wanted that to be enough. But I also really wanted my scholarship back.

The night before the board meeting, Blake found me in our library study room. The same room where we'd spent so many hours, where he'd read Keats, where we'd almost kissed.

"Whatever happens tomorrow," he said, sitting across from me, "I want you to know—this was worth it. Fighting for you was worth everything I lost."

"You lost your family, your money, your entire future as you knew it."

"I gained myself." Blake reached across the table, taking my hand. "Before you, I was just going through motions. Being who my father told me to be. Now I'm figuring out who I actually am. That's worth more than his money ever could be."

"What if the board upholds the revocation? What if we lose?"

"Then we appeal. Keep fighting. Apply to state authorities, education boards, whoever will listen." His grip on my hand was firm. "Rachel, I'm not giving up on you. On us. Not because some board of wealthy people can't see past their donor relationships."

I wanted to believe we'd win. Wanted to think justice would prevail over power. But I'd learned that hope was a fragile thing when faced with institutional weight.

"I'm scared," I admitted.

"Me too." Blake smiled. "But we're scared together. That's better than being scared alone."

We sat in that study room until the library closed, hands clasped across the table, drawing strength from each other for whatever tomorrow would bring.

Because tomorrow, the board would vote.

And we'd find out if standing up to power was enough to overcome it.
