# Chapter 13: Social Pressure

William Ashford's visit changed everything.

Within days, the entire Ashford Academy community seemed to know that Blake's father disapproved of our relationship. Legacy students who'd been merely curious before became openly hostile. Natalie Brennan made cutting comments every time she saw us together. In the dining hall, conversations stopped when I approached legacy tables.

The bookstore became uncomfortable. Students I'd helped for months suddenly needed assistance from Mr. Chen instead. My library shift meant shelving books while overhearing conversations about "scholarship students who don't know their place" and "girls who use tutoring sessions to social climb."

But worse than the legacy students were the whispers from my own side.

"Did you hear Blake's father tried to pay her off?"

"She actually said no to ten thousand dollars? For what, a relationship that's going to end the second we graduate?"

"She's delusional if she thinks this lasts. Legacy boys don't choose scholarship girls when family money's on the line."

Emma defended me fiercely, getting into an actual argument with another scholarship student who suggested I was "making things harder for all of us" by dating Blake. But even she had concerns.

"Rachel, his father is actively working against you. What happens when he escalates?"

"He can't make Blake break up with me."

"Can't he? He controls Blake's funding, his future, everything. Blake's never had to choose between his family and what he wants. What if he can't?"

I didn't have a good answer.

The truth was, I was terrified Blake would choose his father. Would realize that loving me wasn't worth losing everything he'd always known.

Blake, meanwhile, was fighting battles on his own front. His father called constantly, pressing him to "be reasonable" and "think about his future." His mother—who I'd never met—apparently cried on the phone about Blake throwing away his potential.

The pressure was crushing him.

I saw it in the tension in his shoulders, the exhaustion in his eyes, the way he'd go quiet and distant sometimes like he was somewhere else entirely.

One evening, Blake showed up at my dorm room instead of our scheduled tutoring session. His eyes were red, his expression shattered.

"Blake?" I pulled him inside. Emma took one look and quietly left, giving us privacy. "What happened?"

"My father." Blake's voice was raw. "He's threatening to cut me off completely if I don't end things with you. No tuition, no allowance, no support for business school. He wants me to publicly break up with you, apologize for the 'lapse in judgment,' and start dating someone appropriate."

My heart sank. "Blake—"

"He sent me a list. Of appropriate girls. Legacy students from appropriate families." Blake laughed, but it was bitter. "Complete with photos and family net worth. Like I'm shopping for a business merger."

"What did you tell him?"

"I told him no. That I'm not breaking up with you, that I don't care about his money or his threats." Blake met my eyes. "But Rachel, I don't know how to do this without his support. I've never had to think about paying for school or living expenses or any of it. I don't know if I can."

I pulled him into a hug, feeling him tremble against me. "We'll figure it out. Student loans, scholarships, part-time work—it's possible. I'm living proof it's possible."

"But should you have to teach me how to survive without family money? Should I drag you into my family drama?"

"Blake, you're not dragging me anywhere. I'm choosing to be here."

"Even if it costs you? Emma told me legacy students are being awful to you."

I was going to kill Emma for worrying him with that. "I can handle some mean girls."

"But you shouldn't have to." Blake pulled back, his expression anguished. "Maybe my father's right. Maybe I'm being selfish. You had a peaceful life before I complicated it."

"Peaceful and lonely. Blake, don't do this. Don't let your father win by making you doubt us."

"I'm not doubting us. I'm doubting whether I'm worth all this trouble for you."

"You are. You're worth it."

But I could see the uncertainty in his eyes, the weight of his father's expectations crushing him.

---

The next few weeks were hard.

Blake withdrew into himself, consumed by anxiety about his father's threats and guilt about the social pressure I was facing. Our tutoring sessions became strained. He'd show up but barely focus, his mind clearly elsewhere.

Dr. Sullivan noticed. She pulled me aside after class one day.

"Ms. Winters, is everything all right with Blake's tutoring?"

"Yes, ma'am. He's just stressed about finals."

Her eyes were knowing. "I'm aware of the social pressures you're both facing. The Academy's rumor mill is unfortunately efficient."

I felt my face heat. "I'm sorry if it's affecting his academic performance—"

"His performance is fine. I'm more concerned about both of you navigating a difficult situation." Dr. Sullivan's expression softened slightly. "For what it's worth, I think you've been good for Blake academically and personally. Don't let others' prejudices convince you otherwise."

The unexpected support made my eyes sting. "Thank you."

"Just keep helping him believe in himself. That's more valuable than any grade I could give him."

But believing in himself was exactly what Blake was struggling with.

The breaking point came at a legacy student party Blake had been pressured to attend. Kit convinced him to go, said he needed to show face, prove his father's threats hadn't isolated him completely.

Blake asked me to come with him. I knew it was a terrible idea, but I also knew Blake needed support.

The party was in the legacy wing common room—expensive, exclusive, the kind of event I'd never have been invited to on my own. When Blake and I walked in together, the temperature in the room dropped.

Natalie approached immediately, designer dress and cruel smile. "Blake! So glad you could make it. Though I have to say, I'm surprised you brought... her."

"Her name is Rachel," Blake said, his voice tight.

"Right. Rachel. The tutor." Natalie's smile widened. "We were just talking about your father's visit. How is he, by the way? Still trying to protect you from unsuitable influences?"

"Natalie, back off," Kit warned.

"I'm just making conversation. Surely Blake's girlfriend can handle a little conversation?" Natalie turned to me. "You must be so proud. Snagging an Ashford. That's quite the accomplishment for someone from your background."

"My background?"

"Scholarship students, working multiple jobs, desperate for any advantage. I mean, I get it. If I were in your position, I'd probably target a rich boy too. Easy path to financial security."

"That's enough," Blake said, his voice dangerous.

"Is it? Because everyone's wondering, Blake. Is she actually with you, or with your name and money? Have you considered that maybe your father's right to be concerned?"

Blake stepped forward, and for a second I thought he might actually confront Natalie physically. But Kit grabbed his arm, holding him back.

"Let's just go," I said quietly. "Blake, let's leave."

But the damage was done. The entire party had witnessed Natalie's accusations, seen Blake's rage, watched me stand there taking her abuse.

As we left, I heard the whispers starting. Speculation about my motives, agreement with Natalie's assessment, pity for Blake being manipulated by a social climber.

In Blake's car, he punched the steering wheel so hard I flinched.

"I should have defended you better. I should have shut her down completely."

"You did defend me. Blake, you were ready to physically fight for me."

"I should have never brought you there. I knew they'd be awful, and I brought you anyway because I'm selfish and wanted you with me."

"I chose to go. You didn't force me."

Blake was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke again, his voice was small. "Do you ever wonder if they're right? If you'd be better off without all this?"

"No. Do you?"

"Every day. I wonder if loving you is just me being selfish. If I should let you go before my family destroys this completely."

My heart seized. "Blake, don't—"

"I love you, Rachel. I'm in love with you. Have been for weeks, maybe since that first real conversation in the study room." His eyes were bright with unshed tears. "And because I love you, I keep wondering if the kindest thing I could do is walk away. Give you back your peaceful life. Let you find someone whose family won't treat you like this."

"What if I don't want peaceful? What if I want you?"

"Then you're choosing wrong. For yourself."

I stared at him, feeling everything start to fracture. "Blake, please don't do this. Don't let them win."

"Maybe letting them win is the right choice. For you."

He drove me back to my dorm in silence. At the door, he kissed my forehead—gentle, sad, like goodbye.

"I love you," he said. "Remember that, okay? Whatever happens next, I love you."

Then he drove away, leaving me standing in the cold January night wondering if I'd just lost him.

Inside, Emma found me crying.

"What happened?"

"I think Blake's going to choose his father. Choose his future over us."

Emma held me while I cried, and I hated that part of me wondered if Blake was right. If loving him was just making everything harder for both of us.

But I also knew that walking away from him would break something in me I wasn't sure would ever heal.

I loved Blake Ashford.

And I was terrified that love wasn't going to be enough.
