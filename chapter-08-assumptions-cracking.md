# Chapter 8: Assumptions Cracking

By the fifth tutoring session—Thursday evening, late October—something had shifted.

Blake arrived early with coffee from the campus café. He set one cup in front of me without asking.

"Black with one sugar," he said. "Emma told me that's how you drink it."

I stared at the coffee cup, then at Blake. "You talked to Emma?"

"Ran into her at the bookstore. She was very clear that if I hurt you, she knows people." Blake grinned. "I believe her exact words were 'I know where you live, Ashford.'"

Despite myself, I laughed. "That sounds like Emma."

"She's protective. It's nice." Blake sat down and pulled out his paper draft. "I brought my first attempt at the Gatsby essay. Fair warning: it's probably terrible."

I took the stapled pages—five pages of actual writing, complete with citations and a works cited page. The fact that Blake had not only written a full draft but formatted it correctly felt like a minor miracle.

"Let me read it," I said, pulling out my red pen.

Blake watched nervously as I read, which was oddly endearing. The Blake from three weeks ago wouldn't have cared what I thought. This Blake sat forward in his chair, anxious for feedback.

The essay wasn't perfect—his thesis needed tightening, some paragraphs rambled, a few quotes needed better integration. But it was genuinely good. It showed real understanding of *Gatsby*, made interesting arguments about the green light symbolism and Gatsby's performative wealth, and supported claims with textual evidence.

"Blake, this is really good."

His shoulders relaxed visibly. "Really? You're not just saying that?"

"I'm not just saying that. Your analysis of how Gatsby creates a false identity to pursue an impossible dream—that's sophisticated. And this paragraph about the green light representing unattainable desire?" I tapped the page. "This is the kind of insight Dr. Sullivan wants to see."

"But?"

"But your thesis needs work. You're making several interesting points, but they're not quite connected to one overarching argument. Let's tighten it."

We spent forty minutes working through his draft, and I watched Blake actually engage with the editing process. He asked smart questions, pushed back when he disagreed with suggestions, explained his reasoning for structural choices. This wasn't a student passively accepting corrections—this was a writer defending and revising his work.

"Okay," Blake said finally, making a note in the margin. "So if I restructure the second paragraph and add a clearer topic sentence, that flows better into the green light analysis?"

"Exactly. See? You're thinking about essay architecture now, not just sentence-level correctness."

Blake looked at his marked-up draft with something like pride. "I actually wrote this. Like, myself. Without just repeating what someone else said."

"You did. This is your analysis, your arguments, your voice."

"My English teacher freshman year told me I'd never be able to write analytical essays. That I should focus on my strengths in other subjects."

I felt anger spike. "That teacher was wrong."

"She probably thought she was being realistic. Blake Ashford, the kid who can't read aloud without stumbling, trying to write about literature." His voice was bitter. "Maybe she was protecting me from failure."

"Or maybe she gave up on you instead of actually teaching you." I kept my voice level even though I wanted to find that freshman English teacher and give her a piece of my mind. "You can write analytical essays. You just did. And you're going to get a good grade on this paper."

Blake looked at me like he wanted to believe it but wasn't quite there yet. "How do you know?"

"Because I've read hundreds of student essays. This is good work." I held his gaze. "And because you've proven over the last few weeks that when someone actually teaches you instead of just expecting you to magically understand, you're more than capable."

"Is that what you think was happening? That I wasn't being taught right?"

I chose my words carefully. "I think you learn differently than some traditional teaching methods accommodate. And I think when teachers assume struggling means you're not trying or not smart, they stop looking for what actually works."

Blake was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I think I might have dyslexia."

The admission hung between us, huge and vulnerable.

"Have you been tested?" I asked gently.

"No. My father—" Blake stopped, then pushed forward. "When I was in middle school, I suggested it. That maybe something was making reading harder. He said Ashfords don't have learning disabilities, that I was making excuses for laziness."

"That's not how learning disabilities work."

"I know that now. But when you're twelve and your father is basically calling you a liar..." Blake shrugged like it didn't matter, but his face said otherwise. "I stopped asking for help. Figured if I was just lazy, I should try harder. Be less lazy."

"Except you weren't lazy."

"No. I was spending three hours on reading assignments that took other kids forty-five minutes. Getting headaches from staring at words that kept moving around on the page. Feeling stupid because everyone else seemed to understand so easily."

My chest ached hearing the pain in his voice. "Blake, have you talked to anyone about getting evaluated? Dr. Sullivan or Michael Porter?"

"And confirm what my father already thinks? That I'm making excuses?" Blake laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. "That I need accommodations because I'm not as capable as the other Ashfords?"

"Accommodations aren't about being less capable. They're about leveling the playing field so your actual capabilities can show."

"Easy for you to say. You don't need accommodations."

"I needed intensive math tutoring all through high school. I need extra time on math exams because I work through problems slower than other students. I've needed help." I leaned forward. "Needing help doesn't make you weak. It makes you human."

Blake met my eyes, and I saw something crack in his defensive armor. "My father would see it as weakness."

"Then your father is wrong."

"You don't know my father."

"I know he's wrong about this." I spoke with conviction. "And I know that you figuring out how your brain actually works—instead of trying to force it to work like your father thinks it should—that's strength, not weakness."

Blake absorbed that in silence. Then he pulled out his copy of *Gatsby*, pages now covered in sticky notes and annotations. "Can I show you something?"

"Of course."

He opened to a marked page. "When I try to read normally—just straight through—the words blur together. Sentences get jumbled. But when I use these sticky notes to block everything except the line I'm reading, it's easier. I can actually focus."

I looked at the careful system he'd created—sticky notes creating a window that isolated text, colored tabs marking important passages, notes in the margins in his handwriting. "Blake, that's brilliant."

"It takes forever."

"It works. That's what matters."

"Most people don't need tricks to read a book."

"Most people don't need to work two jobs to afford college, but I do. Most people don't struggle with math like I do. Everyone has something that's harder for them. Finding strategies that work isn't shameful—it's smart."

Blake looked at his annotated book like he was seeing it differently. "Dr. Sullivan would probably think it's weird. All these notes and tabs."

"Dr. Sullivan would think it shows dedication and engagement with the text. Which it does." I picked up the book, flipping through the careful annotations. "This is active reading. This is exactly what good students do."

"Really?"

"Really. You're not doing anything wrong. You're doing it right for how you learn."

Blake's shoulders slowly relaxed. "So I don't have to tell anyone? About thinking I have dyslexia?"

"That's your choice. But Blake..." I hesitated, then pushed forward. "If you do have dyslexia, getting officially diagnosed could open doors. Accommodations on exams, extra time, assistive technology. Things that could help not just with literature but with everything."

"And also confirm to my father that I'm broken."

"You're not broken. Your brain just processes information differently." I held his gaze. "But I understand if you're not ready to pursue testing. That's a big decision, especially with family pressure."

Blake nodded slowly. "Can I think about it?"

"Of course."

We worked through the rest of his essay draft in comfortable silence, making notes and discussing revisions. The coffee Blake had brought had gone cold, but neither of us seemed to notice.

As the session wound down, Blake gathered his papers carefully. "Rachel, can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Why are you being so nice about this? About me potentially having a learning disability? Most people would probably think less of me."

I thought about how to answer honestly. "Because struggling with something doesn't make you less intelligent or less valuable. Because I've spent three years at Ashford watching people judge each other based on all the wrong criteria. And because—" I paused, then committed to honesty. "Because I was wrong about you."

"What do you mean?"

"I thought you were a lazy, entitled legacy student who didn't care about education. I judged you completely based on assumptions about your background."

Blake smiled slightly. "To be fair, I was kind of terrible that first session."

"You were defensive. There's a difference." I smiled back. "Turns out you're not lazy or entitled. You're someone dealing with challenges I didn't understand, trying to live up to impossible expectations, and doing your best without support you needed."

"That's... probably the nicest thing anyone's said about me in a while."

"It's just the truth."

Blake looked at me for a long moment, something shifting in his expression. "I was wrong about you too. I thought you'd be judgmental and cold. That you'd look down on me for needing help."

"And?"

"And you've been patient and kind and actually helpful. You made me believe I could do something I thought was impossible." He hesitated. "That means a lot."

The study room suddenly felt smaller, more intimate. I was acutely aware of how close we were sitting, how his eyes were locked on mine, how the air between us had changed.

I cleared my throat, breaking the moment. "Well. You did the work. I just provided some guidance."

"More than that. But I'll take the modest version." Blake smiled, then stood. "Same time Monday?"

"Same time."

"I'll have the revised draft. With the better thesis."

"I know you will."

He left, and I sat in the quiet study room, my cold coffee forgotten, thinking about assumptions and wrong first impressions and how people were so much more complicated than the boxes we tried to put them in.

Blake Ashford wasn't who I'd thought he was.

And maybe—just maybe—I wasn't who he'd thought I was either.
