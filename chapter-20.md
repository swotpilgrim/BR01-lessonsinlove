# Chapter 20: The Threat

Blake found me at the library circulation desk Wednesday afternoon.

"Rachel." His voice was quiet but urgent. "Can we talk?"

My supervisor nodded. I followed Blake to a third-floor study room.

"I wanted to apologize again," Blake said. "For my father. The way he treated you was unacceptable."

"It's okay—"

"It's not okay." Blake ran a hand through his hair. "I talked to him last night. Told him he was out of line."

"How did that go?"

Blake's expression was answer enough.

"Badly. He thinks you're overstepping boundaries. That our relationship has become inappropriate."

My stomach tightened. "What does that mean?"

"I don't know exactly. But he's not happy about the tutoring arrangement." Blake looked worried. "Just be careful, okay?"

I promised I would. Blake left for class, and I returned to the desk with unease settling in my chest.

The summons came an hour later.

"Rachel?" My supervisor held up a note. "The academic support office called. You're wanted in Heritage Hall."

My heart dropped. I grabbed my coat and headed across campus.

Michael Porter's door was open, his expression grim.

"Rachel. Come in. Close the door."

I sat, heart pounding.

"I'm going to be direct." He leaned forward. "William Ashford came this morning. He expressed concerns about your tutoring arrangement with Blake."

"Concerns?"

"He believes you're overstepping boundaries. That the relationship has become too familiar." Michael's tone made clear he didn't agree. "He suggested Blake be assigned a different tutor."

Relief flooded through me. If that was all—

"That's not all." Michael's expression darkened. "Mr. Ashford also made implications about your scholarship."

The relief evaporated. "What kind?"

"The Ashford Foundation provides significant scholarship funding." Michael spoke carefully. "Mr. Ashford implied that if you continue to 'overstep your position,' the foundation might reconsider which students receive aid."

Blood drained from my face. "He threatened my scholarship?"

"Not explicitly. But the implication was clear." Michael looked genuinely angry. "Rachel, what he's doing is unethical manipulation. Using his power to control his son by threatening your education."

"But he can do it."

Michael was quiet. "Yes. He can. If William decides your scholarship should be revoked and manufactures justification, the administration would be hard-pressed to refuse."

My scholarship. Everything I'd worked for. My entire future.

"What do I do?"

"Officially? Maintain professional boundaries with Blake. Keep tutoring strictly academic. Don't give William ammunition." Michael's expression softened. "Unofficially? I'm sorry. It's not fair and it's not right."

"But there's nothing I can do."

"Not against William Ashford. Not directly." He sighed. "Just be careful. I'll do what I can to protect your scholarship if it comes to that."

I left in a daze. The walk back to my dorm felt mechanical—one foot in front of the other, breath clouding in the cold December air. William Ashford was threatening my scholarship because his son cared about me. Because I wasn't the right kind of girl. Because I didn't belong in their carefully maintained world.

My phone buzzed. Blake: *Where are you? Need to talk.*

I ignored it. But he found me outside my dorm.

"Rachel." He took in my expression. "What happened?"

"Michael called me in. Your father went to him. Made threats about my scholarship."

Blake went very still. "What?"

"He told Michael that if I keep 'overstepping my position,' the Ashford Foundation might reconsider my scholarship funding." I looked at Blake. "Your father is using my education as leverage. To force us apart."

"He can't do that."

"He can. And he did." Exhaustion settled in my bones. "Michael was clear. Your father has the power to destroy my scholarship. And he will, unless I stay away from you."

Blake's hands flexed into fists. "This is insane. He doesn't get to dictate who I spend time with."

"He just did."

"Then we fight it. We go to the headmaster—"

"Blake." I cut him off. "Do you understand what's at stake? Not for you—for me. If I lose my scholarship, I'm done. Can't finish senior year. Can't graduate. Can't go to college. Everything gone. Because your father decided I'm not good enough."

"You are good enough—"

"That's not the point!" Frustration broke through fear. "He has power and I don't. You have family money and safety nets. I have this scholarship. That's it. That's the only thing standing between me and my mother's life—working three jobs, choosing between rent and groceries."

Blake looked stricken. "I won't let him do this."

"How will you stop him?" I wrapped my arms around myself. "There's nothing either of us can do. That's how power works."

"So we just give up?"

"I can't afford to fight him. This isn't pride. It's survival. My future." My eyes burned. "I have to end this. Whatever this is—I have to walk away."

"Rachel—"

"I mean it. I care about you. Maybe more than I should. But I can't risk everything. Not even for you."

Silence stretched between us, heavy. Blake's face showed his struggle.

"There has to be another way," he said finally.

"I don't see it." I stepped back. "I'm sorry. But I need you to respect this."

"Pretend we don't care about each other?"

"If that's what it takes. Your father made the stakes clear. My education or you. That's not a choice."

Blake looked like I'd slapped him. "So I just watch you walk away?"

"Yes. Because the alternative is me losing everything." I met his eyes. "You have options. Family money, connections, a secure future. If your father cuts you off, you'll survive. But if I lose this scholarship? I have nothing. No backup plan. No safety net. Just nothing."

The truth hung in cold air.

"I hate this," Blake said quietly.

"Me too."

"It's not fair."

"No." My voice cracked. "But life rarely is. Especially for people like me."

Blake reached toward me, then stopped. "I don't accept this. I'll find a way to fight him."

"Don't. Fighting him makes it worse for me. The best thing you can do is keep your distance."

"And we just pretend these weeks didn't happen?"

"If we have to." I wrapped my coat tighter. "I should go."

"Rachel, wait—"

"Please don't make this harder. I need you to let me go."

The words felt final. Blake stood there, snow beginning to fall, looking lost. I turned and walked into my dorm before I could change my mind.

Inside, I climbed the stairs. Emma wasn't back yet. I sat on my bed, still in my coat.

William Ashford had won. He'd identified the one thing I couldn't afford to lose and used it as a weapon. No dramatic confrontation needed. Just a veiled threat, and I had no choice but to comply.

The cruelty was almost elegant. He didn't forbid Blake from seeing me. He just made it clear that if Blake did, I'd pay the price. So we'd both walk away—not because we wanted to, but because William had made any other choice impossible.

My phone buzzed. Blake again. I turned it off without reading.

Outside, snow continued to fall. Somewhere out there, Blake was probably still standing where I'd left him, trying to figure out how to fight an unfightable situation. And William Ashford was probably satisfied—problem identified, problem eliminated.

Emma came back an hour later, dropping her bag when she saw me still sitting in my coat.

"Rachel?" Her voice was concerned. "What happened?"

I told her everything. William Ashford's visit to Michael Porter. The veiled threats about scholarship funding. The impossible choice laid out in careful, deniable language. Blake's helpless anger when I told him. My decision to walk away before everything I'd worked for was destroyed.

Emma sat beside me on the bed, her presence steady and grounding. "I'm so sorry."

"You warned me," I said. "You told me secrets don't last at boarding schools. That there would be consequences."

"I didn't think his father would go after your scholarship. That's..." She struggled for words. "That's vindictive. Using institutional power against a student."

"I should have known." I finally took off my coat, fingers clumsy with the buttons. "Someone with that much power, that much control over the school—of course he wouldn't hesitate to use it."

"This isn't your fault, Rachel."

"Isn't it? I knew the risks. The class divide. His father's disapproval." I closed my eyes. "I knew all of it and I fell for Blake anyway."

Emma squeezed my hand. "Having feelings isn't a crime."

"No. But apparently it's expensive."

We sat in silence. Outside, snow continued its relentless fall, covering Ashford in white. Making everything look clean when underneath, power played its usual games.

I'd learned a hard lesson. Love—or whatever Blake and I had been building—wasn't enough against systematic power imbalances. At the end of the day, I had to choose survival over sentiment.

Even if it broke my heart.

That night, lying in the dark, I let myself cry. Quietly, so I wouldn't wake Emma. Mourning something that had barely started before it was forced to end.

And hating William Ashford for being willing to destroy a student's future just to keep his son away from the wrong kind of girl.
