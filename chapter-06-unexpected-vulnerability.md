# Chapter 6: Unexpected Vulnerability

Wednesday evening, I arrived at Study Room 3C expecting nothing. Blake would either show up late again with excuses, or he'd show up on time without having done the work, or—most likely—he wouldn't show up at all.

That's what I'd told myself, anyway. That I had no expectations, that it didn't matter whether Blake Ashford took this seriously or not.

But when seven PM arrived and the door opened exactly on time, I felt something loosen in my chest that I hadn't realized was tight.

Blake walked in carrying his bookbag and actually looking like he'd come from somewhere other than crew practice. He wore khakis and an oxford shirt—the Ashford uniform that somehow looked effortlessly preppy on legacy students. His hair was dry. He'd showered and changed.

"On time," he said, and there was something almost defensive in his voice, like he expected me to make a comment about Monday.

"On time," I agreed, keeping my voice neutral. "Did you bring the reading questions?"

Blake hesitated, then pulled a slightly crumpled sheet of paper from his bag. My handwriting at the top: *Chapter Five Observations*. Below it, in Blake's messier script, three observations.

He slid it across the table like he wasn't sure whether I'd criticize or praise him. I picked it up and read:

*1. Gatsby's house is described as "blazing" with light—seems like he's trying too hard to impress*

*2. When Gatsby and Daisy finally meet again it's awkward, which is weird because he's been planning this for years*

*3. At the end of the chapter the rain stops and everything is bright/golden—mood change?*

They were surface-level observations, yes. Not particularly sophisticated. But they were observations—actual engagement with the text, evidence that Blake had read the chapter and noticed things.

"These are good," I said, and meant it.

Blake looked genuinely surprised. "Really?"

"Yes. You noticed specific details and connected them to larger patterns—Gatsby performing wealth, the awkwardness of reunion despite planning, weather reflecting emotional shifts. Those are exactly the kind of observations that build into analysis."

"I thought they were too simple."

"Simple isn't bad. Literary analysis starts with noticing what's actually on the page." I pulled out my own copy of *Gatsby* and opened to chapter five. "Let's build on what you noticed. You said Gatsby's house is 'blazing' with light—why do you think Fitzgerald chose that word? What does 'blazing' suggest versus just 'bright' or 'lit'?"

Blake stared at the page. "That it's... intense?"

"Yes. What else? Think about fire."

"Dangerous? Like he's going to burn out?"

"Possibly. And?"

Blake frowned, thinking. "Maybe desperate? Like he's trying so hard it's almost violent?"

"Exactly." I felt the first spark of real teaching happening, the moment when a student actually engaged instead of just waiting for answers. "Gatsby has spent five years building this wealth specifically to impress Daisy. The 'blazing' suggests how extreme his effort is, how unsustainable. Fire burns bright but consumes itself."

Blake leaned forward slightly, looking at the text like he'd never really seen it before. "So Fitzgerald is... showing us Gatsby's doing too much? That it's not going to work?"

"What do you think?"

"I think..." Blake hesitated, then committed. "I think Fitzgerald is setting up that Gatsby's fantasy is bigger than reality can actually be. He's built this whole life to impress Daisy, but the 'blazing' light shows it's too much. Too performative."

I smiled before I could stop myself. "Yes. Exactly that. You just did literary analysis."

Blake blinked. "That's it?"

"That's the foundation. You noticed a specific word choice, thought about its connotations, connected it to character motivation and broader themes. That's how you build an argument."

"But how do I know if I'm right?"

"There's not always one right answer. What matters is whether you can support your interpretation with evidence from the text. Can you point to other places where Fitzgerald shows Gatsby performing wealth or creating elaborate fantasies?"

Blake flipped through the book, actually looking for evidence instead of waiting for me to provide it. "The parties. The shirts he throws around in front of Daisy. The way his house is positioned to see her dock."

"Perfect. See? You understand this. You've just been looking for the 'right' answer instead of trusting your own interpretation."

Something shifted in Blake's expression—surprise mixed with something that looked like relief. "English teachers always made it seem like there was a specific thing you were supposed to say. Like if you didn't figure out their interpretation, you were wrong."

"Some teachers teach that way," I admitted. "But literature is about multiple possible readings, as long as you support them with evidence. Dr. Sullivan wants to see you think critically, not just repeat what she said in class."

Blake was quiet for a moment, processing. Then: "Can we do another one? My observations?"

I felt that loosening in my chest again. He wanted to keep working. Wanted to learn.

"Your second observation—about the awkward reunion. What did you notice about that scene?"

"Gatsby basically has a panic attack when Daisy shows up. He's been planning this for years, built this whole life for her, and then when she's actually there he acts like a scared kid." Blake flipped to the passage. "He almost runs away. It's weird."

"Why is it weird?"

"Because... he's been so confident about everything else. The parties, the car, the house. But when it matters most, he falls apart."

"And what does that tell you about Gatsby?"

Blake thought about it, really thought. "That the fantasy is easier than reality? Like, he could imagine this perfect reunion, but actually facing Daisy is different. Scarier."

"Keep going."

"Maybe... maybe Gatsby is better at performing than at actually being real. The whole 'blazing' house thing is a performance. But when he has to actually connect with Daisy as a person, not an idea, he doesn't know how."

I wanted to applaud. Instead, I just nodded. "That's sophisticated analysis, Blake. You just identified one of the central tensions in Gatsby's character—the gap between his elaborate fantasy and messy reality."

Blake looked down at his observation sheet like he couldn't quite believe he'd written something worthwhile. "This is what Dr. Sullivan wants?"

"Yes. This kind of thinking, supported with specific quotes and examples. This is exactly what she wants."

"But how do I write it? Like, as a paper?"

I pulled out the literary analysis guide I'd prepared. "Structure. Every argument needs a claim, evidence, and explanation. Your claim is that Gatsby struggles with reality versus fantasy. Your evidence is the 'blazing' house, the awkward reunion, the way he's built an elaborate performance but can't actually connect authentically. Your explanation ties it to Fitzgerald's broader commentary on the American Dream and the dangers of living in illusion."

Blake stared at the guide like I'd just handed him a map to buried treasure. "You're saying I actually understand this stuff?"

"You do. You've just been trying to find some hidden answer instead of trusting what you observe and think."

"English has always been my worst subject," Blake said quietly. "I thought I was just bad at it."

"What subjects are you good at?"

"Business. Economics. Anything with numbers and systems." He looked almost embarrassed. "My father's areas."

"Those require analytical thinking too. You're applying the same skills—looking at patterns, drawing conclusions, supporting arguments with evidence. It's just a different language."

Blake was quiet for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice was different—less defensive, more honest. "My father says English doesn't matter. That it's not important for business. But Dr. Sullivan won't pass me if I don't actually learn it, and I need to pass to graduate."

"Why do you think your father dismisses it?"

Blake shrugged, but I saw the tension in his shoulders. "He thinks humanities are soft. That real success comes from practical skills—business, finance, networking. Reading novels is just..." He trailed off.

"Just what?"

"Just for people who have time to waste." Blake said it like he was quoting someone. Probably his father.

I thought about my mother, who'd encouraged me to read even when we couldn't afford much, who'd taken me to the library every week, who believed stories mattered. I thought about how different Blake's world was from mine—not just in money, but in what was valued.

"Literature teaches you to understand people," I said. "To see different perspectives, to recognize patterns in human behavior, to communicate complex ideas. Those are valuable skills anywhere."

"Try telling that to my father."

"I'm telling you. What your father values isn't the same as what's actually valuable."

Blake looked at me like I'd said something borderline revolutionary. Maybe in his world, questioning his father's judgment was revolutionary.

"Anyway," he said, and I heard him pulling back from that vulnerable moment. "So I just... notice things in the text, think about what they mean, connect them to bigger ideas?"

"That's it. And use specific quotes as evidence."

"And there's not one right answer?"

"As long as you support your interpretation with evidence, there are many possible right answers."

Blake nodded slowly. "Okay. I think I can do that."

"I know you can. You just did."

He gathered his things, but more slowly than he had on Monday. Less eager to escape. "Same thing for next session? Read another chapter, write observations?"

"Chapter six. Three observations. But this time, try to go a little deeper—not just what you notice, but what you think it means."

"Okay." Blake stood, slinging his bag over his shoulder. He paused at the door, looking back at me. "Thanks. For explaining it like that. Making it less... impossible."

The sincerity in his voice caught me off guard. "You're welcome."

After he left, I sat in the quiet study room for a few minutes, trying to process what had just happened.

Blake had shown up on time. Had done the work. Had actually engaged with the material and discovered he could analyze literature. Had been vulnerable enough to admit English was his worst subject, that he struggled, that he'd thought he was bad at it.

And he'd thanked me. Genuinely thanked me.

I gathered my materials slowly, thinking about the Blake who'd called me a charity case last Thursday versus the Blake who'd just left. They were the same person, but also not. Or maybe I was finally seeing past the defensive armor to whoever was underneath.

Either way, something had shifted. We weren't enemies anymore.

We weren't exactly friends.

But maybe—maybe—we were actually becoming teacher and student.

That felt like progress.
