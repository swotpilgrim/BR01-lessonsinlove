# Chapter 9: Shifting Perspectives

Emma noticed first.

Saturday night in our dorm room, I was reviewing Blake's revised essay draft when Emma looked up from her calculus homework.

"You're smiling," she said.

I looked up. "What?"

"At whatever you're reading." Emma's eyes narrowed. "That's Blake Ashford's essay, isn't it?"

"How did you know?"

"Because you've spent the last three weeks talking about Blake constantly. Blake said this. Blake did that. Blake understood the symbolism." Emma closed her textbook. "Rachel, please tell me you're not developing feelings for your tutoring student."

"I'm not—" I stopped. Was I? "We're finally making progress. It's satisfying."

"Uh huh." Emma didn't sound convinced. "And the fact that he's attractive has nothing to do with it?"

"I haven't noticed."

Emma laughed. "You're a terrible liar. Blake Ashford is objectively attractive, and you've been spending three sessions a week with him watching him be vulnerable and work hard."

"It's not like that."

"Maybe not yet. But Rachel, be careful. Rich boys like Blake—they live in different worlds. When they date girls like us, it's usually temporary."

"We're not dating. I'm his tutor."

"You're his tutor who talks about him constantly and smiles while reading his essays on Saturday night."

I looked down at Blake's paper, at the careful revisions he'd made. My chest felt warm and tight.

"I like teaching him," I said quietly. "Watching him gain confidence. It's not romantic."

Emma's expression softened. "Okay. But if it becomes more than that—just protect yourself. Boys like Blake don't usually choose girls like us when it comes down to it."

"I know."

But part of me wondered if Blake was different.

Meanwhile, across campus in the legacy wing, Blake was having a similar conversation.

I wouldn't learn about it until later, but Kit had noticed the change too. Blake spent less time at parties, more time actually studying. He showed up to crew practice on time instead of hungover. He seemed... focused. Different.

"It's the tutoring, isn't it?" Kit asked Sunday morning, watching Blake annotate *Gatsby* with his colored tabs and sticky notes. "You're actually taking this seriously."

"I have to. Academic probation, remember?"

"No, I mean you're taking it seriously seriously. Like you care."

Blake looked up from his book. "I do care. Turns out when someone actually explains things in a way that makes sense, literature isn't as impossible as I thought."

"And the tutor?" Kit grinned. "Rachel Winters. Smart, pretty, completely different from the girls you usually date."

"I'm not dating her. She's my tutor."

"You talk about her constantly."

"I do not."

"'Rachel said,' 'Rachel explained,' 'Rachel thinks I can actually do this.'" Kit's imitation was exaggerated but not entirely inaccurate. "Dude, you're into her."

Blake felt heat creep up his neck. "She's a good teacher. That's it."

"Sure. That's why you asked Emma Bradford what kind of coffee Rachel drinks. That's why you revised that essay three times to impress her. That's why you show up to tutoring sessions early now."

"I show up early because she set ground rules about punctuality."

"Blake." Kit's voice turned more serious. "If you're actually interested in Rachel, you should know—people are going to talk. Your family, your father's friends, the legacy crowd. Scholarship students don't usually date legacy students. It's just not done."

"We're not dating."

"But if you wanted to?"

Blake was quiet for a long moment, looking at his annotated copy of *Gatsby*. Thinking about the last few tutoring sessions, about the way Rachel's face lit up when he understood something, about how smart and patient and unexpectedly kind she'd been despite his initial terribleness.

"If I wanted to," Blake said carefully, "it wouldn't be anyone's business but mine and hers."

"Your father would make it his business."

"My father thinks a lot of things that are wrong."

Kit raised his eyebrows. "That's new."

"What is?"

"You questioning your father. Usually you just go along with what he wants."

Blake thought about his father's dismissal of dyslexia, about being told Ashfords don't have learning disabilities, about feeling broken and stupid because he didn't fit the mold his father had decided he should fill.

"Maybe I'm tired of going along with things," Blake said.

Monday evening, Blake showed up to our tutoring session with his revised essay and something that looked like nerves.

"I made all the changes," he said, sliding the paper across. "Tightened the thesis, restructured the body paragraphs, added better transitions. I think it's good now. Maybe."

I read it carefully. It was good. Really good. The kind of essay that showed genuine critical thinking and sophisticated analysis.

"Blake, this is excellent. Dr. Sullivan is going to be impressed."

His whole face lit up. "Really? You think she'll actually like it?"

"I think you're going to get an A."

"An A?" Blake looked stunned. "In English? Me?"

"You. You earned it with this work."

Blake stared at the essay like he couldn't quite believe it was his. Then he looked at me, and his expression was so open, so genuinely happy, that my breath caught.

"Thank you," he said. "I couldn't have done this without you."

"You did the work. I just—"

"Rachel." He leaned forward, intense. "I've had tutors before. Expensive private tutors my father hired who just gave me answers to memorize, who didn't actually teach me anything. You're different. You made me actually understand. You made me believe I could do this."

The study room felt very small suddenly. I was aware of how close we were sitting, how Blake was looking at me like I'd given him something precious.

"I'm glad I could help," I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended.

"It's more than help. It's—" Blake stopped, seeming to struggle with words. "You see me. Not Blake Ashford III, legacy student, future disappointment to his family. Just... me. And you still think I can succeed."

"Because you can. You are succeeding."

"Because of you."

"Blake—"

"Can I take you to coffee?" The words came out in a rush. "Not as tutor and student. Just as... as people who actually like talking to each other. To celebrate the essay. Or not celebrate, just to—" He stopped, looking almost panicked. "Sorry. That was inappropriate. You're my tutor. I shouldn't have—"

"Yes," I heard myself say.

Blake blinked. "Yes?"

"Yes, I'd like to get coffee. As people who like talking to each other." My heart was racing, Emma's warnings echoing in my head, but I couldn't seem to care. "When?"

"Now? After this session?"

I looked at the study room, at our books and papers spread between us, at Blake's hopeful expression. "We still have forty-five minutes of tutoring left."

"Right. Of course. Professional boundaries." But he was smiling.

"But after," I said. "After, we could go to campus café. If you want."

"I want."

We tried to focus on the remaining session time, but the energy had changed completely. Every time our hands brushed reaching for the same book, every time our eyes met across the table, I felt electricity arc between us. Blake kept losing his train of thought mid-sentence, and I kept rereading the same paragraph without absorbing any words.

"This is useless," Blake said finally, laughing. "I can't concentrate."

"Me neither," I admitted.

"Should we just go now? Call the session early?"

I glanced at the clock. We still had twenty minutes left. "That would be unprofessional."

"Would it?" Blake's eyes were warm, teasing. "Or would it be recognizing that we're not getting any work done anyway?"

He had a point. "Okay. Early dismissal. Just this once."

This was dangerous. Emma was right—Blake and I came from different worlds, had different futures planned. Getting involved was risky at best, potentially devastating at worst. I should say no, maintain boundaries, protect myself from inevitable heartbreak when Blake realized dating a scholarship student didn't fit his legacy image.

But when the session ended and Blake walked beside me through Morrison Library's main floor, past students who definitely noticed Blake Ashford III with the scholarship girl, when he held the door for me and we stepped into the November evening together—I couldn't make myself care about the risks.

The campus café was warm and crowded, filled with students studying and socializing. Blake ordered our coffees—he'd remembered how I took mine—and found us a table in the corner, away from the main crowd but not hidden.

"So," he said, settling into his chair. "This is weird, right? Being somewhere that's not the study room?"

"Weird in a good way," I said.

"Definitely good." Blake smiled, then hesitated. "Rachel, I need to tell you something. About that first session when I called you—when I said that thing about charity cases."

"Blake, you apologized. We moved past it."

"I know, but I need you to understand why I said it. I was humiliated. You saw through all my bullshit immediately, and instead of being impressed by my family name or charm or whatever usually works, you just... saw me failing. And I lashed out because I couldn't handle someone seeing the truth."

"Which was?"

"That I'm not as smart or capable as an Ashford is supposed to be. That I've been faking it my entire life, and you called me on it in the first five minutes."

I reached across the table, not quite touching his hand but close. "Blake, you are smart and capable. You've proven that."

"Because you taught me how to access it. You didn't give up on me even when I was being terrible." He looked at our almost-touching hands. "I've never had anyone believe in me like that before."

"Your friends believe in you."

"Kit likes me. That's different from believing I can actually succeed at things that are hard for me. And my father..." Blake's voice went flat. "My father believes in the Ashford name. Not in me specifically."

"That's his loss."

Blake's expression shifted to something softer, more open. "How do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"Make me feel like I'm enough. Just as I am. Not as Blake Ashford III, not as a legacy student, not as someone who needs to live up to impossible standards. Just... me."

My throat felt tight. "Maybe because that's who I see. Just you."

We sat there in the busy campus café, the noise and activity fading to background, looking at each other like we'd discovered something unexpected and precious.

For the first time since arriving at Ashford, I felt like I might actually belong somewhere.

And that somewhere was next to Blake.
