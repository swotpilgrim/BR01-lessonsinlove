# Chapter 24: Taking a Stand

Blake found me Thursday afternoon in the one place he knew I'd be—the library, working my shift.

I was restocking returns when I heard his voice. "Rachel. Can we talk?"

My heart jumped, then sank. We weren't supposed to be talking. That was the whole point of the past miserable weeks—staying apart to protect my scholarship.

"Blake, we can't—"

"Five minutes. Please." His expression was determined in a way I hadn't seen before. "Just five minutes, and if you still want me to leave after that, I will."

I glanced at my supervisor, who was absorbed in cataloging. Against my better judgment, I nodded.

We went to the same third-floor study room where we'd spent so many hours together. Where he'd read Keats. Where we'd almost kissed. The memories hung heavy in the small space.

"What are you doing?" I asked once the door closed. "Your father said—"

"I know what my father said. And I know what he threatened." Blake's hands were shoved in his pockets, his posture tense. "But I'm done letting him control my life by threatening people I care about."

"Blake—"

"Let me finish. Please." He took a breath. "I talked to Dr. Sullivan yesterday. Told her everything—about the scholarship threats, about how my father used his power to force us apart. She's been documenting it. So has Michael Porter. And Kit's father—he's on the board too—thinks what my father did crosses a line."

Hope flickered in my chest, dangerous and terrifying. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying that if my father follows through on revoking your scholarship, there will be evidence that it was retaliation. Not legitimate academic cause, but punishment for dating me. And that's an abuse of donor authority that even other board members won't tolerate."

"You can't know that for sure."

"No," Blake admitted. "I can't. But I'm tired of living in fear of what he might do. Of letting that fear control everything."

I sank into one of the chairs, legs suddenly unsteady. "Why are you telling me this?"

Blake sat across from me, in the spot that had become his over those weeks of tutoring. "Because tomorrow night is winter formal. And I don't want to go with Natalie."

My heart stopped. "Blake—"

"I want to go with you." He leaned forward, intense and sincere. "I want to walk into that formal with you and show everyone—show my father—that he doesn't get to decide who I care about based on their bank account or social status. That what we have matters more than his approval."

"That's crazy." The words came out breathless. "Your father will retaliate. He'll follow through on the threats."

"Maybe. Or maybe he'll realize that using scholarship leverage to control his son's personal life makes him look petty and vindictive. That some board members will question whether that's appropriate use of donor influence." Blake's eyes never left mine. "I can't guarantee what happens. But I can guarantee that if I go to that formal with Natalie while you work cleanup crew, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."

"This isn't just about regret." Frustration and fear warred in my chest. "This is my future, Blake. My education. Everything I've worked for."

"I know. And if you say no, I'll respect that. I'll walk away and let you protect yourself." His voice was quiet but firm. "But I needed you to know that I'm willing to fight for this. For you. That I'm not just accepting my father's control anymore."

I stared at him, this boy who'd been an arrogant assumption before he became real. Before late-night study sessions and Keats poetry and almost-kisses in empty libraries. Before I fell in love with him.

"What changed?" I asked. "A month ago you were resigned to staying away. Now you want to make a grand gesture that could destroy my scholarship. What changed?"

"I did." Blake met my eyes. "I've spent my whole life doing what my father expected. Being the perfect Ashford heir, following the path he laid out, never questioning his authority. And then I met you, and for the first time I wanted something he hadn't chosen for me. Someone who saw past the name and money to who I actually am."

He stood, pacing the small room. "When my father threatened your scholarship, I was angry but resigned. That's how power works, right? People like him control people like us. But these past weeks, watching you suffer, being miserable myself, my grades tanking because I can't focus—I realized that if I don't fight this now, I never will. He'll control who I date, who I marry, what career I have. Everything."

"So this is about your freedom."

"No." He stopped pacing, looking at me directly. "This is about you being worth the fight. About me finally standing up for something that matters. About refusing to let institutional power and family money decide who gets to be together."

The words hung in the air between us. Outside the window, winter sun caught on snow, making everything bright and sharp.

"I'm terrified," I admitted. "Of losing my scholarship. Of having everything I've worked for destroyed because I fell for the wrong person."

"You didn't fall for the wrong person." Blake's voice was soft. "You fell for someone whose father is willing to abuse his power. That's not the same thing."

"Isn't it? In practical terms?"

"Maybe." He came back to his chair, sitting across from me. "Rachel, I'm not asking you to be reckless. I'm asking you to trust that some things are worth fighting for, even when the odds are bad. And I'm asking if you'll go to winter formal with me tomorrow night."

My heart pounded. Everything logical said to refuse—to protect my scholarship, maintain the distance that kept me safe. But looking at Blake, seeing his determination and fear and hope all mixed together...

"If I say yes," I said slowly, "and your father follows through on revoking my scholarship, what then?"

"Then Dr. Sullivan and Michael Porter present their documentation to the board. Kit's father and other trustees question whether this is appropriate use of donor power. We fight it."

"And if we lose that fight?"

Blake was quiet for a moment. "Then I'll find a way to help. I'll talk to every scholarship program I can find, every financial aid office. I'll..." He stopped. "I can't promise it works out. But I can promise you won't face the consequences alone."

"Your father will cut you off if you do that."

"Let him." Blake's jaw set. "I'm eighteen. I can work, take out loans, find my own way. I'd rather do that than live under his control."

I wanted to believe him. Wanted to think we could fight William Ashford's power and win. But I'd seen what that power looked like up close, felt its weight crushing my choices.

"I need time to think," I said.

"Of course." Blake stood. "The formal is tomorrow at seven. If you decide to come, I'll meet you at the Winter Garden entrance. If you don't show, I'll understand."

He moved toward the door, then stopped. "For what it's worth, these past weeks apart have been the worst of my life. Not because I was miserable—though I was—but because I was miserable and alone. And I realized that's what my father wants. For me to be isolated and controlled, choosing what he approves instead of what matters."

"Blake—"

"You don't have to decide now. Just... think about it." He smiled slightly. "And know that whatever you choose, you're worth fighting for. Even if you don't believe it yet."

He left, closing the door gently behind him.

I sat in the study room for a long time after he was gone, staring at the chair where he'd sat. Where we'd spent hours talking about literature and life and everything that mattered. Where I'd fallen for him without meaning to.

Tomorrow night. Winter formal. The choice between safety and risk, between protecting myself and fighting for what I wanted.

William Ashford had power. But Blake was right—using that power to control his son's personal life through scholarship threats was an abuse. One that other board members might actually question.

Or might not. There were no guarantees.

I left the library eventually, walking back to my dorm in a daze. Emma took one look at my face and said, "What happened?"

I told her everything. Blake's plan. His request. The impossible choice.

"Do you love him?" Emma asked when I finished.

"Yes." The word came out simple and true. "I'm in love with him."

"Then maybe that's your answer."

"It's not that simple. If his father revokes my scholarship—"

"Rachel." Emma cut me off. "I've watched you be careful your entire life. Careful with money, careful with trust, careful with your heart. And I understand why—you've had to be. But Blake is offering to fight for you. To risk his relationship with his father and his family money for you. Don't you think that's worth something?"

"It's worth everything. That's what scares me."

"Being scared makes sense. But hiding from what you want because you're scared—that's just another way of letting William Ashford win."

I lay awake most of that night, thinking about Blake's offer. About courage and choice and what it meant to fight for something when the odds were bad.

About the difference between being careful and being afraid.

About whether some things were worth the risk, even when risking could cost everything.

By morning, I still didn't have an answer. But I had less than twelve hours to find one.

Because Blake would be waiting at the Winter Garden entrance at seven.

And I had to decide if I was brave enough to show up.
