# Chapter 16: Crossing Lines

Blake's text came Saturday afternoon: *Study group tonight? Legacy dorm common room. 7pm. Would really like you there.*

I stared at the message three times before Emma looked up from her calculus homework.

"Blake invited me to study with his friends. In the legacy wing."

Emma's expression shifted from curious to concerned. "Rachel..."

"I know." Blake had been trying so hard to show me I could fit into his world. Maybe I was the one building walls.

"You're going to go," Emma said.

"I'm going to go."

"Wear the navy sweater."

---

The legacy wing had leather armchairs, Persian rugs, and oil paintings on the walls. Everything whispered *money* in a way that made my secondhand sweater feel thin.

I found the common room easily enough. Through the doorway I could see Blake sitting in one of the leather chairs, Kit beside him on a sofa. Natalie Brennan perched on the armrest, perfectly positioned to display her cashmere sweater and pearl earrings. Three other students I vaguely recognized from the dining hall rounded out the group. Books and papers covered the coffee table, but mostly they seemed to be talking.

Blake saw me first. His face lit up in a way that made my heart stutter, and he stood immediately. "Rachel. You made it."

Every head turned toward me. I felt the assessment in their eyes—the calculation of my sweater's brand (none), my shoes (Target), my entire existence in their space.

"Come sit." Blake gestured to the spot next to him. "Everyone, you know Rachel. Rachel, this is Caroline, James, and Marcus."

"The tutor," Natalie said, her smile sharp as glass. "How nice of you to join us."

Kit stood, offering his hand with surprising formality. "Good to officially meet you. Blake says you're the reason he's not failing English anymore."

I shook his hand, trying to read his expression. Was that genuine respect or polite dismissal? "Blake did the work himself. I just helped him find a different approach."

"She's being modest," Blake said, and the warmth in his voice made me acutely aware of Natalie's eyes on us. "Rachel's brilliant. She should be teaching the class, not taking it."

I sat where Blake had indicated, hyperaware of the leather's expensive softness. Blake sat next to me, closer than necessary. His knee almost touched mine.

"We're working on our English papers," Caroline said. "The ones on social class in literature. Dr. Sullivan is being so particular about thesis statements."

"Rachel could help with that," Blake said. "She has this way of breaking down themes that actually makes sense."

"Right." Natalie's tone could have frozen water. "The scholarship student helping us understand class division. How appropriate."

Kit looked uncomfortable. Blake's jaw tightened.

"Natalie—"

"I'm just saying it's ironic." Natalie examined her nails. "But please, Rachel, do share your insights."

I could leave. Instead I said, "What's your thesis?"

Blake's hand brushed mine on the armrest—solidarity.

For twenty minutes, I forgot to feel out of place. We discussed *The Great Gatsby* and *Pride and Prejudice*. When I explained how Elizabeth Bennet's prejudice against Darcy was rooted in class resentment, Marcus took notes.

"That's really helpful," Caroline admitted. "I was trying to argue class doesn't matter in Austen, but you're right—it's the whole point."

"Exactly." I relaxed slightly. "She's showing how class assumptions prevent people from seeing each other clearly."

"Must be nice to have such personal experience," Natalie murmured.

Blake's hand found mine, squeezed hard.

"So what's everyone doing for Thanksgiving?" Kit said, redirecting. "Blake, your family still going to Connecticut?"

"Yeah, the usual." Blake's thumb moved in small circles on my hand. "Four days of my father lecturing about responsibility."

"We're going to Aspen," Caroline said. "Skiing for the week."

"St. Barts," Natalie added. "Two weeks, actually."

Marcus mentioned their family estate in the Berkshires. James talked about visiting relatives in London. They traded stories about private planes and multiple properties.

Blake's hand still held mine, but I felt the distance opening like a chasm. I'd spent Thanksgiving working double shifts, sending money home so my mother could fix our car.

"What about you, Rachel?" Caroline asked. It seemed like genuine interest, but maybe that was worse. "Do you go home for Thanksgiving?"

"I stay here." My voice sounded thin. "I pick up extra shifts. The bookstore gets busy with students buying gifts before break."

Awkward silence. They didn't know how to respond to someone who worked while they vacationed.

"That must be difficult," Kit said. "Being away from family."

"It's fine." I pulled my hand from Blake's. "Holiday pay."

"Right." Natalie's smile was poison. "Different types of students have different types of holiday plans."

"That's enough." Blake's voice was sharp. "Seriously, Natalie."

"I'm just making an observation."

"You're being cruel." Blake stood. "You say something terrible and pretend it's honesty."

"I don't know why you're so sensitive suddenly—"

"Like what? Like Rachel isn't sitting right here?"

Everyone was staring. I felt exposed.

I stood, gathering my things. "I should go. Shift in the morning."

"Rachel—" Blake reached for my arm.

"Thanks for inviting me. Good luck with your papers."

I walked out with my spine straight, face burning. Behind me I heard Blake say something sharp to Natalie. I didn't wait to hear more.

The cold air felt like a slap. I walked fast—away from the leather furniture and oil paintings, away from conversations about St. Barts and Aspen, away from the reminder that I'd never fit into Blake's world.

"Rachel. Wait."

I stopped on the path between dormitories, snow crunching under my shoes. Blake jogged up behind me, his breath clouding in the December air. He wasn't wearing a coat.

"You're going to freeze," I said.

"I don't care." He moved in front of me, forcing me to look at him. "I'm sorry. Natalie was completely out of line."

"She was being honest." The words came out flat. "This doesn't work, Blake. We're from different worlds."

"So what?"

"So I'll never belong there." I wrapped my arms around myself. "You saw how it was. I'm the scholarship student who works while they vacation. The divide is real, and you can't wish it away."

"So we just give up? Pretend these weeks meant nothing?"

"I don't know." And that was the terrifying truth. I didn't know if what we had was strong enough to bridge the gap. Didn't know if I was brave enough to keep trying.

"Tell me what you want." Blake's voice was quiet now, urgent. "Not what you think is realistic or what makes sense. What do you actually want?"

I looked at him. His hair was disheveled, his shirt untucked. His eyes held something raw that made my chest ache.

"I want this to work," I whispered. "I want you. But I'm terrified it's impossible."

"I'm terrified too." He stepped closer. "You think this is easy for me? Watching my friends make you feel like you don't belong? Knowing my father would lose his mind? I'm scared all the time, Rachel. But I'm more scared of not trying."

Snow began to fall, tiny flakes catching in his hair. Around us, Ashford stretched out in picture-perfect silence.

"We're from different worlds," I said, but it sounded like a question.

"Then we'll build a new one." Blake held out his hand. "I'm tired of living according to everyone else's expectations. I want to live according to my own. And this—us—is worth fighting for."

I looked at his hand, then his face. Determination, fear, and hope. My mother had taught me to be practical, to protect myself. But she'd also taught me that courage meant doing what scared you when it mattered.

This mattered.

I took his hand.

Blake's fingers closed around mine, warm despite the cold. He pulled me closer.

"So we try," I said. "Despite everything."

"Despite everything." He smiled. "Fair warning: I have no idea what I'm doing."

"Join the club."

We stood in the falling snow, hands clasped, both terrified and hopeful. This was the midpoint—where we stopped pretending, where we acknowledged what we felt was real.

Behind us, the legacy wing glowed. Ahead, my standard dormitory waited. We stood between worlds, holding onto each other.

"Come on," Blake said. "I'll walk you back."

"You should get your coat."

"In a minute." He didn't let go. "This is more important."

We walked slowly through the snow. When we reached my dorm, Blake squeezed my hand before releasing it.

"Same time next week for tutoring?"

"Yeah." I smiled. "Maybe somewhere else, though."

"Deal." He backed away. "Night, Rachel."

"Night."

I watched him jog back toward the legacy wing, then climbed the stairs. Emma looked up when I entered.

"So?"

"So we're trying. Despite it being possibly impossible."

Emma's face softened. "Just be careful."

"I will."

But careful was already off the table. I'd crossed a line tonight, taken Blake's hand and admitted I wanted this despite the odds. There was no going back—only forward, into whatever came next.

The snow kept falling outside, coating Ashford in white. Everything looked clean and possible, like maybe different worlds could touch after all, if you were brave enough to reach.
