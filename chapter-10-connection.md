# Chapter 10: Connection

The week before Thanksgiving brought the first real snow to Ashford's campus, transforming the brick buildings and manicured lawns into something from a postcard. It also brought Blake's revised *Gatsby* essay back from Dr. Sullivan.

He burst into Monday evening's tutoring session with barely contained energy, dropping his bookbag and pulling out a paper marked with Dr. Sullivan's distinctive red pen.

At the top: **A-**

"Look at this," Blake said, his grin so wide it transformed his whole face. "An A-minus. In English. From Dr. Sullivan."

I took the paper, reading through Dr. Sullivan's comments: *Sophisticated analysis... well-supported arguments... significant improvement in critical thinking skills...*

"Blake, this is amazing!"

"I know!" He dropped into his chair, still beaming. "Dr. Sullivan actually stopped me after class. Said she was impressed with my progress and wanted to know what had changed. I told her I finally had a tutor who actually taught me instead of just giving me answers."

Something warm bloomed in my chest. "You did the work. I just helped you see you were capable of it."

"Rachel." Blake leaned forward, his expression intense. "This is the best grade I've ever gotten in English. Ever. Not just at Ashford—in my entire life. Do you understand what that means?"

I did understand. I'd seen how much Blake struggled with reading, how much shame he carried about English being his "worst subject," how his father dismissed both his struggles and his successes in humanities.

"It means you're not bad at English," I said. "It means you just needed to learn differently."

"It means you're an incredible teacher." Blake reached across the table, his hand covering mine. The touch sent electricity through me. "Thank you. For not giving up on me. For actually caring whether I succeeded."

We sat there, hands touching, looking at each other in the quiet study room. The connection between us felt magnetic, undeniable.

"Blake," I said softly. "We should probably actually do some tutoring."

"Probably." But he didn't move his hand. "Or we could celebrate. Properly this time. Not just coffee at the campus café."

My heart raced. "What did you have in mind?"

"There's a diner in town. Off campus. Actual food, not dining hall mystery meat. We could go this weekend. Saturday?" He looked almost nervous. "If you want. No pressure."

This was crossing a line. Coffee at the campus café could be explained away—just celebrating academic success, nothing romantic. But dinner off campus, away from Ashford? That was clearly a date.

Emma's warning echoed in my head: *Rich boys like Blake—they live in different worlds. When they date girls like us, it's usually temporary.*

But when I looked at Blake—at his hopeful expression, at the way he was looking at me like I was someone precious—I couldn't make myself care about the risks.

"I want," I said. "Saturday sounds great."

Blake's grin returned, even wider than before. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

"Okay. Good. Great." He laughed at himself. "Sorry. I'm not usually nervous about asking someone out."

"You're nervous?"

"Terrified. You could say no, and then I'd have to show up for tutoring sessions twice a week for the rest of the semester knowing you turned me down."

"I didn't turn you down."

"No, you didn't." Blake's thumb traced a small circle on the back of my hand. "Best day I've had in a while. A-minus on my essay and Rachel Winters agreed to go to dinner with me."

"Those are equally significant achievements?"

"The essay wouldn't exist without you. So yeah, equally significant."

We eventually managed to do some actual tutoring—reviewing his next reading assignment, discussing his final essay for the semester. But the energy between us had shifted completely. Every accidental touch felt purposeful. Every shared glance lasted a beat too long.

When the session ended, Blake walked me back to my dorm even though it was out of his way. Fresh snow crunched under our feet, and our breath formed clouds in the cold November air.

"Saturday," Blake said as we reached Morrison Hall's entrance. "I'll pick you up at six?"

"Six works."

He hesitated, then leaned in. For a moment I thought he might kiss me, but he pressed his lips to my forehead instead—gentle, sweet, careful.

"Goodnight, Rachel."

"Goodnight, Blake."

I floated up to my dorm room, my skin still tingling where he'd kissed my forehead.

Emma took one look at my face and groaned. "Oh no. You're in deep, aren't you?"

"He asked me to dinner. Off campus. Saturday."

"Rachel—"

"I know. I know what you're going to say. Different worlds, temporary, I'm going to get hurt." I sat on my bed, still feeling the ghost of Blake's lips on my skin. "But Emma, he's not what I thought. He's kind and hardworking and he looks at me like—like I matter. Like I'm not just the scholarship girl tutoring him."

Emma's expression softened. "I know. I see it too. The way he brings you coffee, the way he talks about you when he thinks you're not listening." She sat beside me. "Just be careful. I don't want you to get hurt."

"I'm being careful."

"Are you? Because careful Rachel wouldn't be going on dates with Blake Ashford. Careful Rachel would keep professional boundaries and protect her heart."

She was right. But careful Rachel also wouldn't have taken a chance on tutoring someone who seemed impossible to teach. Wouldn't have believed Blake could succeed when he'd been written off by other teachers. Wouldn't have seen past his defensive armor to the person underneath.

"Maybe I'm tired of being careful," I said.

Emma pulled me into a hug. "Okay. But if he hurts you, I'm going to do something creative with his expensive car."

I laughed despite myself. "Deal."

---

Saturday arrived too quickly and not quickly enough. I changed outfits four times, trying to find something that looked nice without looking like I was trying too hard. Emma finally intervened, pulling out a dark green sweater dress I'd forgotten I owned.

"This one," she said firmly. "With your tall boots. You'll look amazing."

"It's not too much?"

"It's perfect. Trust me."

At exactly six PM, my phone buzzed: *I'm here*

I took a breath, checked my reflection one last time, and headed downstairs.

Blake stood by his car—a practical sedan, not the flashy sports car I might have expected from a legacy student. He was wearing dark jeans and a button-down under his coat, and when he saw me, his face lit up.

"Wow," he said. "You look beautiful."

Heat crept up my neck. "Thanks. You clean up nice too."

The drive to town was easy, comfortable. Blake had queued up music neither of us objected to, and we talked about everything and nothing—upcoming finals, Thanksgiving break plans, whether *The Great Gatsby* was actually as good as everyone said or just assigned to death.

The diner was exactly what he'd promised—cozy and warm, with checkered tablecloths and a menu of comfort food. We slid into a corner booth, and for the first time since arriving at Ashford, I felt like I could breathe.

"This is nice," I said. "Being off campus."

"Yeah. No one watching, no one judging." Blake looked at me across the table. "Just us."

We ordered burgers and milkshakes, and the conversation flowed as easily as it did during our tutoring sessions, but without the academic focus. Blake told me about growing up under the weight of the Ashford name, about feeling like he was always being measured against impossible standards. I told him about my mom working double shifts, about the library being my refuge growing up, about feeling like I had to be perfect at Ashford to justify taking a scholarship spot.

"That's so much pressure," Blake said. "Having to be perfect all the time."

"Says the guy whose family has literal buildings named after them."

"Different pressure, same weight." He reached across the table, lacing his fingers with mine. "You know what I like about being with you?"

"What?"

"I don't have to perform. I can just be Blake. Not Blake Ashford III, future disappointment to the family legacy. Just... me."

"I feel the same way," I admitted. "Like I don't have to prove I deserve to be at Ashford. I can just be Rachel."

"Just Rachel is pretty great."

My heart skipped. "Just Blake isn't so bad either."

We stayed at the diner for hours, talking until the waitress gave us subtle hints that they were closing. Blake drove me back to campus, parking in the lot near Morrison Hall instead of dropping me at the door.

"I had a really good time tonight," he said.

"Me too."

"Can we do this again? Like, officially? Not as tutor and student, but as... whatever this is?"

"I'd like that."

Blake smiled, then leaned across the console. "Can I kiss you?"

My breath caught. "Yes."

He kissed me softly, carefully, like I was something precious. His hand came up to cup my face, and I felt warmth spread through my entire body.

When we finally pulled apart, we were both smiling.

"Definitely doing that again," Blake said.

"Definitely."

I floated back to my dorm, my lips still tingling, my heart full of something dangerous and wonderful.

Emma was waiting up. She took one look at my face and grinned. "That good?"

"Better."

"Then I'm happy for you." She hugged me tight. "Just remember—if he breaks your heart, I know where he parks his car."

I laughed, but part of me wondered if Blake Ashford had already stolen my heart completely.

And I wasn't sure I wanted it back.
