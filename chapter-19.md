# Chapter 19: Father's Visit

Thanksgiving break at Ashford was quiet. The campus felt hollow—just skeleton staff and the handful of students who couldn't go home. I was one of five scholarship students working the break, picking up extra shifts while the wealthy kids ate turkey with their families.

I didn't mind it, mostly. The bookstore was busy before students left. My manager gave me a small holiday bonus. I sent most of it home to my mom.

The quiet had its appeal. I could study without competing for tables. The dining hall served a nice Thanksgiving meal for those of us who stayed.

But I missed Blake.

Four days had felt manageable Friday night. By Monday afternoon, I found myself thinking about him constantly. The Keats poem kept running through my head. Blake's voice reading about wanting to freeze a perfect moment forever.

Tuesday morning brought fresh snow. I was restocking the poetry section when the door chimed.

"Rachel?"

I turned. Blake, snowflakes in his hair, smiling.

"You're back," I said. My heart jumped.

"Came back early. Father had business—board meeting. I rode with him." Blake lowered his voice. "I was hoping you'd be here."

"You came to see me?"

"Is that okay?"

More than okay. "What about your family Thanksgiving?"

"Survived it. Lots of lectures." He made a face. "Want to take a walk?"

I checked with my manager, who waved me off. I grabbed my coat and followed Blake outside. The campus looked beautiful under snow, magical in its emptiness.

"I missed this," Blake said. "Being able to just walk without everyone watching."

"You missed Ashford?"

"I missed you." He said it simply. "Four days felt really long."

"It did."

We walked across the quad, footsteps crunching in fresh snow. Blake told me about Thanksgiving—the formal dinner, his mother's friends, his father holding court. It sounded exhausting.

"My cousin asked about college plans. I told him I was thinking about teaching."

"What did he say?"

"He laughed. Thought I was joking." Blake's voice was wry. "When he realized I was serious, he looked confused."

"But you're still thinking about it?"

"More than thinking." He stopped, facing me. "Working with you made me realize that's what I want. Does that sound stupid?"

"No," I said softly. "It sounds like you found something real."

Blake smiled, genuine and unguarded. I wanted to reach for his hand. But we were in the middle of the quad, visible from multiple buildings. So I kept my hands in my pockets.

"Come on," he said. "Let's walk to the library."

We headed toward Morrison, still talking easily. Blake made me laugh. I told him about the small Thanksgiving dinner. The conversation flowed naturally—comfortable and right.

I was mid-sentence when Blake stopped suddenly.

I followed his gaze and felt my stomach drop.

A man near Heritage Hall, watching us. Same height as Blake, same build, but older and harder. Expensive wool coat. Commanding presence.

William Ashford.

"Shit," Blake muttered.

William was walking toward us, expression unreadable, eyes assessing. I became acutely aware of how we must look—close together, laughing, easy familiarity. Not like tutor and student.

"Blake," William Ashford said when he reached us. His voice was cultured, controlled. "I thought you'd be in your room unpacking."

"Ran into Rachel. We were just taking a walk." Blake's voice was carefully neutral. "Father, this is Rachel Winters. My tutor. Rachel, my father, William Ashford."

William's eyes moved to me, and I felt the assessment like a physical weight. He took in my coat—warm but definitely not expensive. My boots with the worn heels. Everything about me that screamed scholarship student, here on merit and financial aid rather than family legacy.

"Miss Winters." He didn't offer his hand. "The tutor. Blake mentioned you'd been helping with his English coursework."

"Yes, sir." I kept my voice steady despite my racing heart. "Blake's made excellent progress this semester."

"Hmm." The sound was noncommittal, dismissive. William looked back at Blake. "I trust you're ready for your final exams. Your performance this semester is particularly important given your college applications."

"I'm ready," Blake said. There was an edge to his voice now.

"Good." William's attention returned to me briefly, his expression making it clear I was beneath his notice. "Miss Winters, thank you for your assistance with my son's studies. I'm sure you have work to return to."

It was a dismissal. Clear and cold. Blake's jaw tightened, but before he could say anything, I spoke.

"Of course. I should get back to my shift." I met Blake's eyes briefly. "See you later."

I walked away with my spine straight and my face burning. Behind me, I heard William say something to Blake in a low voice, heard Blake's sharp response. But I kept walking, needing distance between myself and William Ashford's contempt.

Back at the bookstore, I tried to focus. But my hands shook. I couldn't stop replaying the encounter. The way William had looked at me—like something distasteful. The dismissal. The clear message that I didn't belong near his son.

Blake texted an hour later: *I'm sorry about my father. Can we talk?*

I waited until my shift ended: *It's fine. Probably good I met him.*

*It's not fine. Meet me for dinner?*

The dining hall was nearly empty. Blake was already there, expression tight with frustration.

"I'm sorry," he said immediately. "My father was completely out of line."

"He was being protective." I sat, picking at my food. "I'm the scholarship student tutoring his son. I get why he'd be cautious."

"Cautious?" Blake's voice rose, then moderated. "He was rude. Dismissive."

"Maybe that's what I am to him." The words came out bitter. "Blake, your father took one look and knew exactly what I was. Not appropriate for an Ashford."

"I don't care what he thinks is appropriate."

"But he does care. And he has power." I looked at him directly. "What did he say after I left?"

Blake was quiet. "He asked how much time I've been spending with you. Said it looked inappropriate. That people might get the wrong idea."

My stomach sank.

"Or the right idea," Blake said quietly. "He saw us, Rachel. How we are together. He knew immediately this is more than tutoring."

"What else?"

"That I need to be careful about associations that reflect poorly on the family." Blake's frustration was evident. "He mentioned the winter formal. Ordered me to ask someone appropriate from our social circle. He specifically mentioned Natalie."

The winter formal. Of course William would want Blake with someone from the right family.

"Maybe you should," I said.

"What?"

"Ask Natalie." The words hurt. "Blake, your father saw us for two minutes and knew this was trouble. Your father is on the board of trustees. He has power over my education. What happens if he decides I'm a bad influence?"

Blake looked stricken. "He wouldn't—"

"Wouldn't he? He can make my life very difficult."

Snow fell outside the windows, soft flakes in darkness.

"I won't let him bully you," Blake said. "Or me."

"He has a thousand ways to control us." I met his eyes. "I need you to understand what's at stake. It's not pride. It's my entire future."

"So we just give up?"

"I'm saying be realistic." My throat felt tight. "Your father knows now. He's going to be watching."

"You're the best thing that's happened to me this year."

The honesty nearly broke me. "Blake—"

"I know it's complicated. But doesn't what we have matter?"

"Of course." I blinked hard. "But caring doesn't change reality. Your father made that very clear."

Blake reached across the table, taking my hand. "I'm not giving up. There has to be a way."

I wanted to believe him. But William Ashford's contempt kept replaying in my mind.

"We should keep more distance," I said quietly. "Until things settle."

"Rachel—"

"I'm not saying never. Just... more careful." I squeezed his hand before pulling away. "We can't give him ammunition."

Blake finally nodded. "Okay. Careful. But not forever."

"Not forever," I agreed, unsure I believed it.

We finished dinner in silence. When Blake walked me back, we kept deliberate distance. No hand-holding. Just two students walking.

At the dorm entrance, Blake stopped. "I hate this."

"Me too."

"It's not fair."

"No." I managed a small smile. "But life rarely is."

"Rachel, I—" He stopped. "I meant what I said Friday. About falling for you. That didn't change."

"I know." My voice was barely a whisper. "Mine didn't either."

We stood in the cold, separated by his father's disapproval and reality. So close and impossibly far.

"Goodnight," Blake said.

"Goodnight."

I watched him walk away, then climbed the stairs. Emma wouldn't be back until tomorrow. I sat on my bed, still in my coat.

Blake coming to the bookstore. The happiness. Then William Ashford's appearance. His cold assessment.

And Blake's insistence we could find a way.

I wanted to believe him. But I'd seen the look in his father's eyes. William had identified me as a threat in minutes, and men like him didn't tolerate threats.

The question was what he'd do about it. And whether we could survive whatever came next.

Outside, snow continued to fall, covering everything in white. But underneath, the complications remained—class divides, power imbalances, the gap between what we wanted and what was allowed.

I fell asleep thinking about William Ashford's dismissive contempt, and Blake's hand across the table, and the growing certainty that this was going to get worse before it got better.

If it ever got better at all.
