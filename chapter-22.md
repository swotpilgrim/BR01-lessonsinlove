# Chapter 22: Miserable Apart

The week before winter formal was the worst.

I threw myself into work and studies, trying to fill every moment so I wouldn't think about Blake. It didn't work. I'd be shelving books and remember his laugh. I'd be reading for class and think about how he'd struggled with the same passage. I'd see couples walking together across the quad and feel the absence like a physical ache.

Emma found me crying in our dorm room one night. I'd held it together all day, but something about the darkness and quiet broke my carefully maintained composure.

"Oh, Rachel." She climbed onto my bed, pulling me into a hug. "It's okay. Let it out."

"I miss him," I sobbed into her shoulder. "I know I shouldn't, I know it was barely anything, but I miss him so much and I hate that his father gets to do this. Gets to decide who I can care about based on my bank account."

"I know. I'm so sorry."

"It's not fair." The words came out broken. "I worked so hard to get here. Did everything right. And William Ashford can just... erase it all because I'm not the right kind of person for his son."

Emma held me while I cried, not offering platitudes or solutions. Just being there, solid and present while I fell apart.

Eventually the tears stopped. I pulled back, wiping my face with my sleeve.

"I'm in love with him," I whispered. "I didn't mean to be, but I am."

"I know."

"And he's going to winter formal with Natalie Brennan, and I'm going to work cleanup crew, and that's just... that's how it is."

"That's bullshit," Emma said fiercely. "That's not how it should be."

"But it's how it is."

We sat in silence for a while. Outside, snow fell steadily, coating Ashford in its endless white.

"For what it's worth," Emma said finally, "I don't think Blake is doing any better. Kit told Marcus who told Sarah who told me that Blake barely talks anymore. Just goes through the motions."

"He'll be fine. He has resources, options, a whole world that works for him."

"Maybe. But he doesn't have you."

The words hit harder than Emma probably intended. Blake didn't have me. And I didn't have him. And William Ashford had accomplished his goal with surgical precision—separating us without having to actually forbid anything, just making the cost of togetherness too high.

Meanwhile, Blake was struggling too.

I only knew because Dr. Sullivan pulled me aside again Friday afternoon.

"Rachel, I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest with me." She closed her office door behind us. "Is there a reason Blake Ashford's academic performance collapsed immediately after your tutoring arrangement ended?"

I chose my words carefully. "Perhaps the different teaching approach isn't working for him."

"Or perhaps something else is going on." Dr. Sullivan's gaze was sharp. "His latest essay was barely coherent. This from a student who was writing thoughtful, sophisticated analysis just three weeks ago."

"I'm not sure what you want me to say, Dr. Sullivan."

"I want you to tell me if William Ashford's interference has created an untenable situation for both you and Blake." She leaned forward. "I'm aware of the family's influence. But I'm also Blake's teacher, and I'm watching a bright student sabotage himself."

"Maybe he's just distracted. Winter formal, college applications, senior year stress."

"Maybe." Dr. Sullivan didn't sound convinced. "Or maybe he's heartbroken and doesn't know how to function through it."

I stayed silent.

"I can't force William Ashford to behave ethically," Dr. Sullivan continued. "But I can document what's happening. And if it comes to defending a scholarship student against inappropriate pressure, I will."

"Thank you," I said quietly. "But please don't put yourself at risk for this."

"That's my choice to make." She smiled slightly. "Sometimes the right thing to do is worth the risk. Even at institutions that value donors over principles."

I left her office feeling both grateful and more burdened. Dr. Sullivan was willing to fight for me, but I didn't want her caught in William Ashford's crossfire.

Saturday, I saw Blake at the library. He was alone in one of the study rooms, staring blankly at his laptop. His new essay, probably. The one Dr. Sullivan said was incoherent.

I shouldn't have stopped. Should have kept walking. But something about the defeat in his posture made me pause.

Through the glass, Blake looked up. Our eyes met.

The world stopped.

I saw everything in his face—the misery, the longing, the exhaustion of pretending. All the things I was feeling reflected back at me. For a moment, the careful distance we'd maintained collapsed, and it was just us. Just Rachel and Blake, who'd found something real before it was stolen away.

Then someone walked past, breaking the spell. I turned and fled before I could do something stupid. Like go in there. Like offer to help. Like risk everything we'd been protecting by staying apart.

My heart pounded as I left the library. Too close. That was too close.

Blake's perspective reached me through Kit again. He caught me Monday morning before class.

"He's not sleeping," Kit said without preamble. "Hasn't been for weeks. Just lies awake thinking about you."

"Kit, you can't keep doing this."

"Someone has to." Kit's usual easy confidence was gone. "Look, I'm not great with this stuff. I've never seen Blake like this. He's always been the guy who has everything figured out, you know? But now..." He shook his head. "Now he's a mess. And the formal is in five days, and Natalie keeps planning their whole night, and Blake just... he's not there. He's going through motions because his father expects it, but he's not actually present."

"What do you want me to do?" Frustration leaked into my voice. "I can't fix this. His father made sure of that."

"I don't know. I just thought you should know that he's not okay. That giving you up isn't making him happy. It's destroying him."

"It's destroying me too," I admitted. "But that doesn't change anything. William Ashford has all the power. We don't."

Kit looked like he wanted to argue, but finally nodded. "For what it's worth, I think what his father did was wrong. Using your scholarship like that. It's..." He struggled for words. "It's made me think about things differently. About how people like us use power without even realizing it."

"Welcome to the view from the bottom," I said without heat.

He left, and I stood in the hallway feeling hollowed out. Blake wasn't sleeping. Neither was I. We were both miserable, separated by circumstances neither of us could control.

And in four days, I'd watch him go to winter formal with Natalie while I cleaned up after their perfect evening.

---

That night, Emma convinced me to take a walk to clear my head. We bundled up and headed out into the cold December night.

"You know what's ridiculous?" I said as we crunched through snow. "William Ashford wanted to keep us apart. Mission accomplished. But Blake's miserable, I'm miserable, his grades are tanking, and I can barely function. So really, everyone loses except William's sense of control."

"Parents are great at that," Emma said. "Winning battles, losing wars."

"Blake's not even fighting back. He's just... accepting it. Going to formal with Natalie, doing what Daddy wants."

"Is that what you wanted him to do?" Emma asked quietly. "Fight back?"

I thought about it. "I don't know. Yes? No? I wanted him to respect what I asked—to stay away so I don't lose my scholarship. But I also hate that he's just accepting his father's control. That he's not even angry about it."

"Maybe he is angry. Just not where you can see it."

We walked in silence for a while. The campus was beautiful under snow and stars, peaceful in a way that felt almost cruel given my internal turmoil.

"I keep thinking about the library," I finally said. "The night before Thanksgiving, when we almost kissed. What if those students hadn't interrupted? What if we'd actually..." I trailed off.

"Would it have changed anything?"

"I don't know. Maybe it would have been worth the consequences. Maybe I'd have the memory of kissing him to hold onto now instead of just the almost." I shoved my hands deeper into my coat pockets. "Or maybe it would hurt worse, knowing exactly what I lost."

"Life is full of almosts," Emma said. "Sometimes the worst ones are the near-misses."

We were almost something. Blake and I. Almost brave enough, almost free enough, almost powerful enough to make it work.

But almost doesn't count when faced with institutional power and family wealth and the reality that some gaps are too wide to bridge.

Four more days until winter formal. Four more days of this hollow pretending.

And then... what? We'd continue avoiding each other through graduation? Blake would go to college with someone appropriate, marry someone from his world, live the life his father had mapped out?

And I'd finish at Ashford, go to whatever college I could afford, and remember the boy who read Keats in an empty library and looked at me like I was worth fighting for.

Until his father made the cost too high, and we both chose survival over each other.

That night, I dreamed about the study room again. But this time, when Blake asked if he could kiss me, I said no. I said we couldn't, that his father would destroy me, that wanting each other wasn't enough.

And even in the dream, saying no broke both our hearts.

I woke up to gray winter light filtering through the dorm window. Three more days until winter formal. Three more days of being miserable apart because staying apart was the only way to survive.

Emma was still asleep. I lay there listening to her breathe, thinking about Blake lying awake in the legacy wing, both of us counting down to a formal that would make our separation official and visible.

And hating William Ashford for being willing to break his own son's heart just to maintain control.
